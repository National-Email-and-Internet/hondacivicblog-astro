It isn’t hard to believe that the 2010 Civic continues to rank #1 in the Affordable Small Cars Category. Honda continues to present a winning combination, which truly makes Civic a leader in its class, both for style and reliability. Its fuel efficiency pleases the frugal minded folk, but equally makes sense to all the people watching the gas prices closely.

The new 2010 model comes virtually unchanged, as the 2009 Civic was selected “Best Buy” by the Consumer Guide. So if the 2010 model is essentially the very same thing, one may consider buying a 2009 model and saving some dough. You can actually get a pretty good deal, as the dealers are eager to get the 2009 models of their lots.

Despite the outstanding reliability, and fuel economy the 2009 and 2010 Civics have received some harsh comments. The main dispute was its exterior, particularly the snub-nose and a rather odd minivan-like windshield. Some commented that the design was just uninteresting, “you could drive and not notice a half of dozen of Civics on your way to work.” Others criticized the dual-tiered instrument as overburdened and mesmerizing.

But can all of this really be a major drawback when we are talking about the unparalleled quality and solid reputation for quality? The engineering of Civic is as strong for the 2010 model as ever and they have always held their resale value well. The car has a truly dynamic performance combined with the fuel-sipping manners –setting a standard in the highly competitive compact cars class. In addition, Civic boasts excellent safety scores in both federal government and insurance industry, and comes equipped with anti-lock brakes and six airbags!

However, making your mind to buy a Civic is the easy part. What’s difficult is choosing the one that is right for you. The basic Civic is either a sedan or coupe and it comes in different trims such as DX, LX, LX-S, EX with the price range from roughly $15,500 to all the way up to $22,000. The Honda Civic SI boasts increased performance-oriented trim, with 57 extra horsepower, pushing the price up to extra $6,500. The other interesting options are Civic Hybrid with the prices of about $10,000 higher than for a base Civic, and the Civic GX which runs on compressed natural gas.
