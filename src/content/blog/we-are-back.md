Hello readers. I am very sorry about the lack of new content during the last couple of months. I have been very busy with a new job and have not had time to keep the site up-to-date. Today I had some free time and decided to refresh the site by going back to the original design and changing the layout a bit. Here are some things you might notice:

– Recent blog posts no longer show up on the front page. Only our "top story" of the day is displayed.

– There are no more links to post categories. Some links to those posts have been integrated into the menu list. All posts are still here though.

– The sidebar has been re-arranged. I believe it is a lot easier to navigate.

– There are more ad's. In order to keep this site up and running I need some form of income. There will be ad's at the top of every post.

Well I hope you like the original design and our new layout. If you have any suggestions or comments feel free to contact us using our Contact page. Thanks!
