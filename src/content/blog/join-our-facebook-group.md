This site is closely tied into our Facebook group, "Civic Drivers". I ask all of you to join if you use Facebook. In the group you can post photo's of your ride, ask questions on our discussion board, and chat on the wall. Civic Drivers is one of the largest Honda groups on Facebook. We have over 600 members and that number is going up everyday. Please join and make sure to tell your friends about it!
