As the New Year unravels before us we are lucky to find that some of the  things remain true and worthy of our trust. So does the 2010 Honda  Civic Hybrid – it delivers what it promises – taking you any place with  superb fuel efficiency. As you probably know, the four-door Hybrid takes  advantage of the blend of gasoline and electric power to give you an  unbeatable 45 mpg, not only to save your money, but to truly take care  of the environment. At a price starting from $23,800, the Hybrid enters  the ring to compete with the VW Jetta TDI, the Civic GX running on  natural gas, and of course the new Toyota Prius hybrid.

The system used in the 2010 Hybrid boasts 5 various modes to let the  electrics and gas engine co-work. Theoretically the Hybrid is capable  of running on electric power alone, but you would be surprised to see it  for any noticeable time span. The engine is a 93-horsepower 1.3-liter  powertrain especially suitable for working together with the hybrid  system. It is assisted in its task by a 20-horsepower electric motor.

Some of the expert reviewers have already tried the new 2010 Civic  Hybrid on the road. Like all the other Civics, it behaves extremely well  in the domain of handling, making relaxed driving a dream. But some of  the complaints were that the steering felt somewhat numb and not overly  responsive, and that the gasoline engine has to rev at high speeds when  the situation calls for it. However cruising around town at moderate  speeds is pleasurable, with only electric power engaged at times.

To sum it all up, the 2010 Honda Civic Hybrid presents a real and  tried way to reduce your fuel expenses, in the same time not showing off  your green credentials to everyone. And as a tip for potential buyers,  the all new 2010 Honda Civic Hybrid sedan is virtually unchanged from  the previous year model, so you may as well save your money on a lightly  used model from 2009.
