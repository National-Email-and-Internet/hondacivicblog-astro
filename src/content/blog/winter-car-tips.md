It's the time of year when the leaves are falling, a fat man slides down your chimney, and its freakin' cold outside! You need to protect your Honda from the harsh conditions if you want it to last in the blistering cold. Here are just a few basic tips to ensure you and your car's safety.

**Tires** – Make sure you are driving on all-season or winter tires with good tread. It's very important to be able to control your car on those snow and ice covered roads. Make sure your tires are properly rotated and aligned. Your tires should not b worn down to less than 2/32 on an inch for normal tires and 5/32 of an inch for snow tires.

**Anti-Freeze **– It may not sound important during cold weather, but your cooling system is crucial to surviving the cold. Make sure you have plenty of anti-freeze in your system. If you havent replaced the anti-freeze in your car for more than 2 years, it's time to flush it and get some more anti-freeze. Sometimes anti-freeze can lose its ability to withstand freezing tempetures. Or, if you have added water to your mix, make sure to flush the system and add new anti-freeze. Make sure no hoses are cracked or have leaks. Check your radiator, thermostat, and radiator cap. Make sure your heater and defroster are functional.

**Oil** – It's a good idea to change your oil before the winter months. When changing your oil, select the lowest recommended grade of oil in your owners manual. For most passenger cars, this grade is 5W-30. Also consider using a synthetic oil, as this kind of oil resists cold temp. sludge buildup.

**Battery** – It's a good idea to replace your battery every three to four years. If you don't think your battery can hold up in the cold weather, have a shop check it out for you. If it's time to replace your battery, look for one with more starting power and higher cranking amps.

Those are just the basics in winter car care. Hopefully your Honda will be reliable through the winter months. If you have done all the things outlined in this article you should be a happy driver this winter. Happy Holidays!
