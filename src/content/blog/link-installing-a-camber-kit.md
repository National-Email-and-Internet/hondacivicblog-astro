If you have a lowered Honda (or any car for that matter) more than two inches you might want to look into a camber kit. Left unchecked, camber wear will wear down your tires faster than normal. If you want more information about the effects and causes of camber wear, please visit one of our previous posts, [here](http://www.hondacivicblog.com/archives/15). If you are interested in installing a camber kit, please visit this link for help. The example car is an Integra, but the basic process is similar for all Honda's. Please enjoy!
