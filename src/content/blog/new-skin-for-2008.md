It's a new year and a new year deserves a new skin. I have added a new skin to the site to update the old, basic look. This new skin is somewhat simple but at the same time more complex and better looking than the old one. The posts are still easy to read and the information is organized neatly. I think the old blue/white color's were not representing Honda well. So I switched to a red/black/white look which really scream's Honda. I have also added little Honda logo's around the site to further incorporate a Honda theme. I hope you enjoy this skin as much as I do. Please feel free to give me feedback!
