While sales of the [Honda Civic Hybrid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_Civic_Hybrid) Sedan hasn't taken off like the [Toyota Prius](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Prius), oddly enough the 2009 Civic Hybrid provides similar gas mileage for a lower price!

In general, reviews are saying that in comparison to the Prius, the Civic Hybrid (with it's 90-hp, 1.3 litre engine and 20-hp electric engine) isn't as &#8216;slick' but it is good enough to drive – that isn't meant to &#8216;damn with faint praise', rather, put things into context; there is nothing wrong, it just isn't &#8216;standout' good.

Some highlights: Incredible interior room, good steering, breaks and handling

New in 2009: front bumper and grille styling, head and tailight assemblies, USB interface, Bluetooth, GPS, stability control.

A nice gallery of pictures is below
