[Honda](http://www.honda.com/) has rolled out their new line of Civics for 2009 and include a nice upgrade to the Civic Coupe along with the Civic Sedan and [Civic Hybrid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_Civic_Hybrid) (will post some news and shots of those later).

According to the honda website, styling changes include: new 17-inch alloys, bolder grille, clear turn-signal lenses, rear wing spoiler, Exhaust tips, and updated headlight and tailight sets.

Here are some cool shots of the new 2009 [Honda Civic Si](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_Civic_Si) Coupe:

On the performance front the 2009 Honda Civic Si Coupe is available with the 197-hp, 2.0-Liter, DOHC i-VTEC® 4-Cylinder Engine (the K20Z3 engine), a helical limited-slip differential, a close-ratio 6-Speed Manual Transmission,  MacPherson Strut Front/Multi-Link Rear Suspension and Honda's trademarked Drive-by-Wire™ Throttle System.

To top it all off, the 2009 Civic Si delivers pretty decent gas mileage for essentially a performance vehicle getting 21 city/29 highway/24 combined mpg.
