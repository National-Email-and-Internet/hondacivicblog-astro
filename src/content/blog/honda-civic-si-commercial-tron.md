How cool is this [Honda Civic Si](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_Civic_Si) commercial! A very nice departure from the standard fare car commercial – it is a Tron-like (as in the movie Tron) landscape and a civic racing along the grid avoiding obstacles and racing another auto. It wins and yes, it is a Civic Si!

This Civic commerical is a real creative twist and very well done, I applaud the team that did it – I wish more car commercials were like this!
