Since it first drove onto the market in 1973, the Honda Civic has been hailed by critics and drivers alike for their reliability, longevity, and fuel efficiency. In fact, Civics are so indestructible, that the model my parents drove me home from the hospital in as a newborn was the first car I drove 16 years later when I got my license. It was still running fine one year later when we drove it to the local junkyard, my father opting to retire it before it started to fall apart – but who knows when that would have been? Oh, and we replaced it with another Civic.

There are countless worthy years and models to choose from when buying a [used Honda Civic](http://www.autohound.ca/Ontario/GTA%20Region/Toronto/Honda/Civic/default.aspx?key=422306), with many online sites, like AutoHound, AutoHopper and AutoTrander, offering competitive deals. However, in the long and esteemed history of the Civic there are two models that truly stand out in terms of style, fuel efficiency, and engine power: the 2006 Sedan Hybrid and the 2000 Coupe Si.

The [2006 Honda Civic Sedan Hybrid](http://www.autobytel.com/content/shared/articles/templates/index.cfm/article_id_int/2556) is part of the newest generation of Civics, and conservatively claims it can reach up to 42 mpg – some experts actually put output at 50 mpg. Like all models built after 2005, the Hybrid features the redesigned hood and windshield design, as well as improved dashboard gauges that make the driver feel they are actually in the cockpit of a space-ready hovercraft instead of a Civic. It is powered by a four cylinder engine that works seamlessly with an electric component to provide 110 horsepower. Not everyone will like the redesigned interior or loss of engine power, and not enough time has passed to really gauge the lifespan of the hybrid engine. So when purchasing a 2006 Hybrid, don’t settle for anything more than 45,000 miles – just to be safe.

It is hard to go wrong with the 2000 Honda Civic Coupe Si, a sturdy little car that consistently hits 25 mpg. The Si was reintroduced to Honda lovers in the second half of 1999 and features 160 horsepower from a 1.6 liter VTEC engine. The 2000 Si is visually updated from previous Si models through the addition of spoilers, 15-inch alloy wheels, and side graphics. Air condition, CD players, keyless entry, and power doors and windows are also included features on this model. Like most Hondas, this model is worthwhile up to 100,000 miles, and costs around $7,000.

The bottom line is that when you are looking to purchase a used car, it is hard to beat the quality, lasting performance, and reliability of a Civic – unless the competition is the equally as worthwhile Honda Accord.
