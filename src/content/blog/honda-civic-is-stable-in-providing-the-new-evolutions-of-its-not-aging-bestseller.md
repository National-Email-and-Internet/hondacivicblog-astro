The auto critics were well aware that it was in Detroit that Honda rolled out the new 2012 Civic concept.

Now as we enter the hot summer months, Honda's ninth-generation Civic should had already arrived to the dealerships, following a somewhat delayed schedule, comparing to the timetable of the rest of the automakers.

But Civic’s appearance at the Detroit auto gives us a quick preview of what will eventually land in the showrooms. Following the traditional Honda fashion, the concept looks practically identical to car, which will go in production, though it comes equipped with a bit more aggressive wheel and headlights treatments.

The concept shown in Detroit is nothing, but a styling mule – there are no signs of an interior or the engine. Honda purposefully chose not to announce any engine details for the new model, but one could safely conclude that if will be a four-cylinder engine line, which will definitely include a base version and a higher-charged option for the sportier Si trim. The current Civic in production uses a 1.8-liter, 140-hp I4, while the Si comes equipped with a 2.0-liter, 197-hp I4.

Much discussion has been devoted to Honda's decision to postpone the introduction of the new Civic, giving birth to rumors of Honda scrapping its work and choosing to get back to the drawing board and the basics. However, as a Honda spokesman confirmed, this was not the case. The spokesman attested to the fact that the delay held up the introduction of the new Civic only by three or four months, and the changes were introduced in response to market demand.

The result that we see is a car that is evolutionary, rather than evolutionary. But is the bad at all? I reminded of the success of the American classic 18 wheelers or the Harley Davidson motorcycles, which continue to stay on their path, perfecting what they already know is the best in its class. Dimensions are close to those of the vehicle currently in production. The suspension retains the familiar MacPherson struts in the front and a multilink setup for the rear.

And finally, the answer that is of interest to all the prospective buyers of the new Civics. The base pricing should be match closely with the current car's price of $16,355 for the coupe and $16,555 for the sedan. So, whose will it be?
