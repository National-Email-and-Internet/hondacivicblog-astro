The third generation Honda Civic, known as the "Wonder Civic" in Japan, debuted in 1983 and represented a complete reimagining of what a compact car could be. Its revolutionary design and engineering won multiple Car of the Year awards worldwide.

## Revolutionary Design

The third generation featured a striking wedge-shaped profile that was unlike anything else on the road. The low hood, steeply raked windshield, and tall greenhouse maximized interior space while improving aerodynamics.

Key design features:
- Dramatically lower hood line
- Improved aerodynamic efficiency
- Taller greenhouse for better headroom
- More glass area for improved visibility

## The CRX Arrives

This generation saw the introduction of the **Honda CRX**, a sporty two-seater based on the Civic platform. The CRX became legendary for its combination of:

- Lightweight construction (as low as 1,700 lbs)
- Nimble handling
- Exceptional fuel economy (HF model achieved 50+ mpg)
- Fun-to-drive character

## Engine Technology

The D-series engines debuted:

- **D15A2** - 1.5L engine for the fuel-efficient HF model
- **D15A3** - 1.5L 3-valve per cylinder for the sporty Si

Fuel injection became available on higher trim levels, improving both power and efficiency.

## Si Performance

The third generation introduced the **Civic Si**, establishing a performance nameplate that continues today. The Si featured:

- Fuel-injected engine
- Sport-tuned suspension
- Front disc brakes
- Sport seats
- Distinctive styling cues

## Innovation & Recognition

The third generation Civic won numerous awards:
- Motor Trend Car of the Year (1984)
- Japan Car of the Year
- European Car of the Year

## Legacy

The "Wonder Civic" proved that compact cars could be exciting, innovative, and desirable. It established design and engineering philosophies that would guide Civic development for decades.
