![Second Gen Civic](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d1/Honda_Civic_SL_1980.jpg/640px-Honda_Civic_SL_1980.jpg)

The second generation Honda Civic was introduced in 1979 and represented a significant step forward in size, refinement, and features. Building on the success of the original, Honda created a more mature and capable compact car.

## Design Evolution

The new Civic was noticeably larger than its predecessor, offering more interior space and improved comfort. The design language evolved toward a more angular, modern look while maintaining the practical hatchback configuration that made the original so popular.

## Engine Options

The second generation continued to use Honda's innovative CVCC technology:

- **1.3L CVCC** - Economy-focused option
- **1.5L CVCC** - More power for highway driving

Both engines maintained excellent fuel economy while meeting increasingly strict emissions standards without catalytic converters.

## Available Body Styles

- 3-door hatchback
- 5-door hatchback  
- 4-door sedan
- Station wagon

## New Features

The second generation introduced several improvements:

- Optional power steering
- Improved sound insulation
- Better crash protection
- More refined suspension
- Available automatic transmission improvements

## Market Impact

The second generation Civic solidified Honda's position in the American market. As fuel prices remained high following the oil crises of the 1970s, the Civic's combination of fuel efficiency, reliability, and quality made it increasingly popular.

## Legacy

This generation laid the groundwork for Honda's continued innovation in the compact car segment, proving that small cars could be practical, efficient, and desirable.
