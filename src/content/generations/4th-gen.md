The fourth generation Honda Civic (EF chassis) introduced groundbreaking suspension technology and became one of the most beloved platforms in Honda history. Known as the "Grand Civic" in Japan, this generation established the Civic's reputation for exceptional handling.

## Double-Wishbone Revolution

The fourth generation was the first Civic to feature **double-wishbone suspension** at all four corners—a setup typically reserved for sports cars and luxury vehicles. This sophisticated suspension design delivered:

- Superior handling precision
- Better ride quality
- Reduced body roll
- Improved tire contact

This suspension philosophy would continue through the sixth generation and define Honda's commitment to driving dynamics.

## VTEC Debuts

The fourth generation saw the introduction of Honda's revolutionary **VTEC (Variable Valve Timing and Lift Electronic Control)** system in the Japanese market B16A engine. VTEC allowed:

- Fuel-efficient operation at low RPM
- High-revving power at high RPM
- Best of both worlds in a single engine

The B16A produced an impressive 160 PS from just 1.6 liters—over 100 hp per liter—an remarkable achievement for a naturally aspirated engine.

## Engine Options

### North American Market
- **D15B** - 1.5L economy engine (92 hp)
- **D16A6** - 1.6L Si engine (108 hp)

### Japanese Market
- **B16A** - 1.6L DOHC VTEC (160 PS)

## CRX Si

The CRX Si continued as a lightweight sports coupe with:
- 108 hp 1.6L engine
- Independent rear suspension
- Quick-ratio steering
- Legendary go-kart handling

## Body Styles

The fourth generation offered multiple configurations:
- 3-door hatchback
- 4-door sedan
- Station wagon
- CRX sport compact

## Tuner Culture

The EF chassis became a cornerstone of Honda tuner culture. Its lightweight construction, excellent suspension geometry, and engine swap possibilities made it popular for:

- Autocross
- Road racing
- Drag racing
- Street performance

## Legacy

The fourth generation Civic established Honda's performance credentials and created a template for future generations. The combination of sophisticated suspension, available VTEC power, and lightweight construction made it a timeless enthusiast platform.
