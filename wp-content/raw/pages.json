Ward&#8217;s Auto Magazine calls the Honda CVCC one of the top 20 engines of the twentieth century!</p>\n<p>According to Honda &#8220;(the) CVCC engine, delivered clean emissions and excellent fuel economy. The CVCC was based on Honda’s Low-Emission Engine Method, where the engine’s combustion process itself produced lower emissions, eliminating the need for a catalytic converter to treat the exhaust gas.&#8221;</p>\n<p>After damning research by a Japanese doctor in the mid &#8217;60s that exposed unusually high levels of lead concentration in residents that lived near the roadside and connecting that to car emmisions, Honda assembled a team of 10 R&amp;D engineers and created the Air Pollution Research Group.</p>\n<p>Formed in 1965, this research group&#8217;s mandate was to develop low emission engine technology in anticipation of the companies future plans to vastly expand it&#8217;s export activities. In a radical &#8211; and successful &#8211; twist, the Japanese research team decided to NOT follow the trends of the other auto manufacturing companies as they believed that it would only put them in the same place and not provide any competitive advantages.</p>\n<p>They decided to investigate the development of leaner combustion by using a &#8216;pre-chamber&#8217; which had been used in diesel technology, but not a standard feature in traditional gasoline engine designs.</p>\n<p>That fore-sight to take a different route ended up in the development of the CVCC engine: C (“Compound”) represented the engine mechanism with two combustion chambers: main and auxiliary. V (“Vortex”) represented the vortex, or swirl, generated in the main chamber. Caused by a jet of flame from the prechamber injected via a nozzle, the vortex had the effect of increasing the speed of engine combustion. CC (“Controlled Combustion”) represented the engine’s ability to properly control the speed of combustion (<a href=\"http://world.honda.com/history/challenge/1972introducingthecvcc/text05/index.html\">from Honda</a>)</p>\n<figure style=\"width: 630px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" title=\"October 12, 1972 - Tokyo, Soichiro Honda at the CVCC launch\" src=\"http://world.honda.com/history/challenge/1972introducingthecvcc/img/cvcc_pho_01.jpg\" alt=\"October 12, 1972 - Tokyo, Soichiro Honda at the CVCC launch\" width=\"630\" height=\"465\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">October 12, 1972 - Tokyo, Soichiro Honda at the CVCC launch</figcaption></figure>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size: 1em\">Related articles</h6>\n<p><a href=\"http://jalopnik.com/391914/1979-honda-civic\">1979 Honda Civic [Down On The Street]</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://world.honda.com/history/challenge/1972introducingthecvcc/\">1972 Honda Civic CVCC</a> &#8211; Honda</p>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px;height: 15px\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Zemified by Zemanta\" href=\"http://reblog.zemanta.com/zemified/5e090a10-c7ca-4170-a20a-3bb5cbd62c61/\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: medium none;float: right\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/reblog_e.png?x-id=5e090a10-c7ca-4170-a20a-3bb5cbd62c61\" alt=\"Reblog this post [with Zemanta]\" /></a></div>\n",

All models (including the base model) come standard with ABS and side and curtain airbags. Additionally, the 2006 models acquired a ULEV-2 (Ultra Low Emission Vehicle) rating and boast a more powerful 1.8 liter engine than the 2005 counterparts, but still retain almost equal fuel economy. In the North American market, the sedan, coupé, coupé Si, and Hybrid models are available. A Sedan Si has been announced for the 2007 model year (this is the first ever Civic Si sedan). The Sedan and Coupe all come in 3 available trims (DX, LX, EX) while the Civic Si and Hybrid are sold &#8220;as is&#8221; with relatively few options (such as a navigation system, automatic day/night compass mirrors, and wheel locks).</p>\n<p>The DX model is the base model that comes equipped with LATCH, immobilizer theft-deterrent system, power windows, daytime running lights (DRL), 15&#8243; wheels with covers, driver&#8217;s seat height adjustment, and other features (All Canadian sold Civics have the 160 watt stereo system) as well as the DX-G model in Canada adds air conditioning, auxiliary input jack for portable audio players, power door locks, remote keyless entry and storage console armrest.</p>\n<p>The LX model adds a 160 watt 6-speaker stereo system, air conditioning, 16&#8243; wheels with covers (Alloy wheels in Canadian LX models), cruise control, MP3/audio jack, passenger side walk in with memory (Coupe only), floor mats, security system with remote entry and Canadian sold models (except for DX) include heated exterior mirrors.</p>\n<p>The EX model adds a moonroof, 4 wheel disc brakes, 16&#8243; alloy wheels, an additional 12-volt accessory outlet (for a total of 2), a 350 watt stereo system with 7 speakers (Coupe only, the Sedan EX comes with a 160 watt stereo system), exterior temperature indicator, a foldable rear arm rest with integrated cupholders, and an optional voice-activated navigation system.</p>\n<p>The Coupes come standard with a rear spoiler and on the EX models (only) have chrome finish on the exhaust pipe. They are typically a bit sportier than their Sedan counterparts and cost US$200 (AU$254) less in the US and CDN$200 (AU$217) more in Canada at base MSRP. It should be noted that the EX model of both the Coupe and Sedan are actually a bit smaller, in terms of interior room (because of the sunroof, which takes up head-room), than their DX and LX counterparts. MSRP is US$14,810 (18.881) for the DX Manual Coupe to approximately $21K for the Si models.</p>\n<p>Only a continuously variable transmission (CVT) is offered for the 2006 Honda Civic Hybrid, which gains more power and a mileage boost to an EPA estimated 49/51 mpg (city/highway). It achieves an AT-PZEV emission rating.</p>\n",

Unlike the original EK9 version, which was produced solely in Japan, the EP3 Civic Type-R was produced in the United Kingdom and exported to Japan. The EP3 Civic Type-R had a specific output of 200 PS (197 hp/147 kW) at 7400 rpm, a redline of 8000 rpm, a six-speed manual transmission, reworked exterior with a bullet-like hatchback design, aeroform bumpers, spoiler, and 17 in wheels. A switch to front MacPherson struts was made for this generation, while the rear retained double wishbones. The interior of the Type-R includes Recaro seats and a Momo steering wheel, and the model also includes Type-R-specific badging, a helical limited-slip differential, and has been reported to accelerate from zero to 60 mph in about 6.6 seconds (6.4 in facelifted model).</p>\n<p>Near the end of the 2003 production models Honda changed the Civic. The grill was changed to a single bar instead of louvers and the gauges on the dash were changed to a more sporty look. The tail lights remained the same but when illuminated created a circle.</p>\n<p>The new Sport Hatchback model with futuristic styling was unveiled in August 2005 for the European market only. This model featured from launch a 1.4 L I-DSI and a 1.8 L i-VTEC rated at 83 PS (81 hp/61 kW) and 140 PS (138 hp/103 kW) respectively, with 177 and 207 km/h (110 and 129 mph) top speeds and 14.2 and 8.6 sec 0-100 km/h sprint. The Sport Hatchback is also available with a 2.2 L I-CTDI diesel engine from the Accord, Edix/FR-V and CR-V, rated at 140 PS (138 hp/103 kW) and is capable of 205 km/h (127 mph) and accelerating from 0-60 mph in 8.4 seconds.</p>\n<p>1.) <strong>Coupe</strong> &#8211; Trims available in the coupe body style were the DX (up to 2003), EX, HX and LX (EM2).</p>\n<p>2.) <strong>Hatchback</strong> &#8211; The Si (EP3), marketed as the SiR in Canada, was the only hatchback of its generation.</p>\n<p>3.) <strong>Sedan</strong> &#8211; Trims available in the sedan body style were the DX, EX, GX (starting in 2003) and LX (ES1/2, EN2, ES1, respectively).</p>\n<p>All DX and LX models had the D17A1. The HX had the D17A6 and the EX had the D17A2. The Si had the powerful K20A3. The GX ran on CNG, but the option to have the gasoline version of the engine became available in 2005.</p>\n",

The Civic Type-R had a maximum output in the range of 189 PS JIS (185 hp/132 kW), increased over the more common 160 PS (158 hp/118 kW) B16A engine in the SiR/VTi models, and included various alterations to the chassis to improve handling and reduce weight (such as better welding of the frame, and removal of the radio and noise-suppressing materials).</p>\n<p>1.) <strong>Coupe</strong> &#8211; Trims available in the coupe body style were the DX, EX, HX and Si (only 1999 and 2000) (designated as the EJ6/8/7 and EM1, respectively).</p>\n<p>2.) <strong>Hatchback</strong> &#8211; Trims available in the hatchback body style were the CX and the DX (EK4).</p>\n<p>3.) <strong>Sedan</strong> &#8211; Trims available in the sedan body style were the DX, LX (EJ6) and EX (EJ8).</p>\n<p>In 1999 the Civic sedan had some updates for both the interior and exterior. The car received a face lift which moved the grill forward. The rear tail lights were flipped upside-down so to speak. On the 1996 to 1998 sedans and coupes, the stop lights were on top of the reverse and turn lights, in 1999-2000 the reverse and turn lights were on top of the stop lights. Inside the center console had a makeover. The sliding air system controls were replaced by rotary ones, which created free space.</p>\n<p>The CX was the lightest and did not have features such as a sunroof, which made it even lighter. In Canada, the EX was called the Si and the Si was called the SiR.</p>\n<p>The CX hatchback and all DX models with a manual transmission did not have power steering. DX models with automatic transmission did have power steering standard. DX models also did not come with options such as power locks and windows, cruise control, and sunroof. LX trim (sedan only) added the power windows and locks and cruise control. EX trim added the sunroof. HX trim levels were similar to LX sedans but without cruise control.</p>\n<p>Special Edition (SE) models were available in various North American markets. 1996 coupes could be had in a rosewood color in limited production. This color was a common color outside North America, but was fairly rare to see in US models.</p>\n<p>Most models had a standard AM/FM radio in the center dashboard with a backlit LCD display (except CX had no radio) but a slave cassette player or CD player was available through dealer-installed options and was installed in the forward portion of the console and was hidden from view when the cupholder was open. EX models had the slave cassette player standard. Dealers also offered AM/FM cassette and AM/FM CD decks to replace the stock radio. All vehicles were equipped with four speakers, radio wiring (prep), and an antenna regardless of whether or not they had a radio.</p>\n<p>All CX, DX, Value Package, and LX models used the D16Y7. The HX had the D16Y5 and the EX had the D16Y8. The Si used the B16A2.</p>\n<p>Most models (DX, LX, EX, Si) were available with a standard 5-speed manual transmission with a hydraulic clutch, or an optional 4-speed automatic transmission with floor shifter and shift interlock which prohibited the transmission from shifting out of &#8220;Park&#8221; unless the brake was applied. The HX model was offered with the 5-speed manual or a CVT Continuously Variable Transmission which offered three driving ranges, D (for normal driving), S (for spirited driving with higher engine speeds), and L (to keep the engine running as high a speed as possible). The conventional 4-speed automatic was not available on the HX model.</p>\n",

The body was redesigned with a lower hood line and more glass, giving less drag. The model range was fairly limited for the US, whereas the European and Japanese markets had a wider range. A 1500 cc 16-valve fuel injected engine giving 92 hp (68 kW) was used in the DX hatchback/sedan, new LX sedan and the American market wagon. The Si and four-wheel drive wagons were powered by a 1.6 L 16-valve engine, rated at 108 hp (81 kW). The base hatchback had a 70 hp (52 kW) version of the same 8-valve engine. All engines sold in the US were fuel injected. Carbureted models were available elsewhere. All Civics had a double-wishbone suspension. In 1990, the EX trim was introduced. Four-wheel drive wagons had standard steel wheels (white steel wheels with matching center caps where optional), a 6-speed manual transmission (with a super-low gear left of first) or an optional 4-speed automatic. Four-wheel drive was also available on the sedan in some markets.</p>\n<p>Base model of the 4th generation Civic was a 1.2L SOHC, this single carbureted engine was not available for the European and American market. For Europe the base model was the 1.3Luxe (23L/23U for the Japanese market) 1.3L SOHC single carbureted engine. Next engine was the 1.4L which was not available in the USA and Japan. It was a 1.4L SOHC dual carbureted engine that was available only in 1988 and 1989. (replaced by the 1.5i GL and GLX in 1990). The 1.5L SOHC engine came in a wide variety, dual-point injection, single carbureted and dual carbureted. Those engines were available in the JDM 25X/25XT, USDM DX and the USDM STD model (USDM base model), EDM 1.5i GL and GLX (only difference between EDM GL and GLX is a different standard equipment and a different FDR). The LX model offered over the base/DX model such accoutrements as power windows, power mirrors, power door locks, and cruise control. Next in line was the 1.6L SOHC. Simply 1.6i for the European market and Si for the American market (US top model). (not to be confused with the JDM Si which is a 1.6L DOHC) Second highest model was the JDM Si. It was equipped with a 1.6L DOHC (ZC) engine and delivered 130hp. The EDM 1.6i GT and 1.6i-16 (depends on country) had a ZC like 1.6L DOHC engine and had a stock 124hp (D16Z5) or 130hp (D16A9). All DOHC engines are equipped with Honda&#8217;s multipoint fuel injection system (although there seems to have been a 1.6L DOHC non-VTEC with dual carburetors for the 4th gen.). Top model of the hatchback was the Japanese SiR with the 160hp B16A engine. In Europe the SiR was called 1.6i-VT and had a similar B16A1 engine. These top models of the 4th generation Civic were one of the first Honda&#8217;s that were equipped with the famous VTEC system (the NSX was the first, the JDM 90/91 Integra XSi/RSi also had a B16A). See the VTEC section for more info on the SiR and 1.6i-VT.</p>\n<p>In 1990 the 4th gen Civic had a light &#8220;facelift&#8221;. Some things that changed was the front bumper design, the front corner lights no longer had the two screws on the outside, the gauge cluster cover shape slightly changed, tail light units design changed and USDM Civics&#8217; got door mounted seatbelts (88-89 frame mounted).</p>\n",

The sedan and hatchback shared the same dashboard, but the CRX and wagons both had their own unique dash (CRX having a covered cubby in the middle of the dash, the wagon having a pop up set of vents which could be used or retracted into the dash). A new 12-valve (three valves per cylinder) 76 hp 1500 cc engine was introduced.</p>\n<p>The base hatchback and CRX HF used the 1300 cc 8-valve engine giving 60 hp (45 kW). The DX and 1500S model hatchbacks shared the new 1500 cc engine with the sedan, wagon and CRX 1.5. The CRX was a Civic with a slightly different body, being strictly a 2-seater in the US &#8211; the rest of the world having a rear seat; this was a lockable storage compartment on US models. The wagon was available in front-wheel drive or part-time four-wheel drive, operated by a push button on the dash. In 1986, the Civic got flush-mounted headlights. The CRX Si was visually altered by body colored bumpers, new alloy wheels and a body colored rubber spoiler-now mounted on the back of the trunk as opposed to the top portion of the trunk. The hatchback received an Si model, with the fuel injected engine, a pop-up glass sunroof, body colored bumpers and sedan-style disk wheel covers. Also in 1986 a four-speed automatic and an Si version of the Civic hatchback were introduced. In 1987, the four-wheel drive system on the wagon was changed; a new real-time four-wheel drive system featured an automatic viscous coupling that shifted power to the rear wheels automatically when needed.</p>\n",

Before the Civic, Honda was known around the world mostly as a builder of well-designed, high quality motorcycles such as the 100cc &#8220;Cub&#8221;, and the famous 1969 Honda 750. The tiny Honda N360 coupe was introduced in 1967 in several countries, but not in the United States, as it was too small for the U.S. market. When the slightly larger Honda Z600 coupe was introduced in the U.S. in 1971, it sold well enough. However, customers immediately requested something similar, but larger, with front disc brakes and a more powerful engine to handle the higher speeds found on American highways.</p>\n<p>Honda began selling the 1169 cc (70 in³) transversely mounted inline four-cylinder Civic for about US$2,200 (AU$2,804). The car produced roughly 50 hp (37 kW) and included power front disc brakes, vinyl seating, reclining bucket seats and a woodgrain-accented dashboard. The hatchback version added a fold-down rear seat, an AM radio and cloth upholstery. Options for the Civic were kept to a minimum, consisting of air conditioning, an automatic transmission, radial tires and a rear wiper for the hatchback. The car could achieve 40 mpg (6 L/100 km) on the highway and with a small 86.6 inch (220 cm) wheelbase and 139.8 inch (355 cm) overall length the vehicle weighed 1,500 pounds (680 kg). The four-wheel independent suspension and four speed manual transmission (or two-speed &#8220;Hondamatic&#8221; automatic).</p>\n<p>The Civic&#8217;s features allowed this &#8220;econobox&#8221; to out perform American competitors such as the Chevrolet Vega and Ford Pinto, which had been manufactured to a lower level of quality compared to the Civic to keep their costs down. When the 1973 oil crisis struck, many Americans turned to economy cars. Reviews of American economy car quality were poor, and getting worse due to spiraling costs for manufacturers. Japanese culture had a long-standing tradition of demanding high-quality economy cars, and the growing American desire in the 1970&#8217;s for well-made cars that had good fuel mileage benefitted the standing of Honda, Toyota, and Datsun in the lucrative U.S. market.</p>\n<p>For 1974, the Civic&#8217;s engine size grew slightly, to 1237 cc and power went up to 52 hp (39 kW). In order to meet the new 5-mph (8 km/h) bumper impact standard, the Civic&#8217;s bumpers grew, making its overall length increase to 146.9 inches (373 cm), 7.1 inches (18 cm) more.</p>\n<p>The <a title=\"Honda Civic CVCC engine\" href=\"http://hondacivicblog.com/honda-engine-list/1973-15l-ed1-cvcc\">CVCC (Compound Vortex Controlled Combustion)</a> engine debuted in 1975 and was offered alongside the standard Civic engine. The optional 53 hp (40 kW) CVCC engine displaced 1488 cc and had a head design that promoted cleaner, more efficient combustion. The CVCC design eliminated a need for a catalytic converter or unleaded fuel to meet emissions standards (nearly every other U.S. market car for this year underwent the change to exhaust catalysts and the requirement to use only unleaded fuel). Due to California&#8217;s stricter emissions standards, only the Civic CVCC was available in that state. A five-speed manual transmission became available this year, as did a Civic station wagon (only with the CVCC engine), which had a wheelbase of 89.9 inches (228 cm) and an overall length of 160 inches (406 cm). Civic sales also increased and topped 100,000 units for this year.</p>\n<p>1978 brought slight cosmetic changes, some changes were as a black grill, rear-facing hood vents (which replaced the sideways versions) and new turn indicators. The easiest way to recognise a 1978 model from an earlier example is to look at the front turn indicators: prior to 1978, they looked like foglights mounted in the Civic&#8217;s grill, whereas in 1978 they were smaller rectangular shaped ones and were mounted within the bumper bar. The CVCC engine was now rated at 60 hp (45 kW) with 20 ft-lb torque.</p>\n",

This list includes most inline 4-cylinder engines only, starting in alphabetical order from A-series on.</p>\n<h4>A16A1</h4>\n<p>The A16A1 was a Carbureted 1.6 litre engine used in the 1982-1985 Honda Accords in North America and in some of the 1986-1989 Accords in the non-USDM market.</p>\n<p>&#8211; Carbureted<br />\n&#8211; Displacement: 1596 cc<br />\n&#8211; Bore: 80 mm<br />\n&#8211; Stroke: 79.5 mm<br />\n&#8211; Compression 9.0:1<br />\n&#8211; Valvetrain SOHC non-VTEC<br />\n&#8211; Power: 88 hp @ 6000 rpm, 91 ft/lb torque @ 3500 rpm</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>A18A</h4>\n<p>The A18A engine was the 1.8 liter engine found in the 1982-1985 Honda Accords as well as the 1984-1987 <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Honda Prelude\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_Prelude\" rel=\"wikipedia\">Honda Prelude</a> in the US.

It was available in both carbeurated and PGM-FI versions. They were found in both Accords and Preludes throughout the 1980s. The A20A1 and A20A2 were the carbeurated versions of the A20A engines. It was available in the 1984-1987 Honda Preludes as well as the 1982-1989 Accord DX and LX. They are the same engine, the only difference between them being that the A20A2 has no emissions components, so it has a slightly higher power output (hp and tq numbers for A20A1 only).</p>\n<p>&#8211; Carbeurated<br />\n&#8211; Displacement: 1955 cc<br />\n&#8211; Power: 98 hp, 109 ft/lb torque @ 3500 rpm</p>\n<h4>A20A3/20A4</h4>\n<p>The A20A3 and A20A4 were the fuel injected versions of the A20A engines. They were run by Honda&#8217;s PGM-FI system on a partial OBD-0 computer. Again, there is no real difference between the A20A3 and the A20A4 besides the A20A4 having a slightly higher power output because of not having emissions components (hp and tq numbers for A20A3 only). The A20A3 was offered in the 1984-1987 Honda Prelude 2.0Si, the 1985 and 1989 <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Honda Accord\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_Accord\" rel=\"wikipedia\">Honda Accord</a> SE-i, and the 1986-1989 Honda Accord LX-i.</p>\n<p>&#8211;
