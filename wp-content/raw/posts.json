Environmentalists are all smiling about their hybrids and how much less fuel they use and how eco-friendly they all are for using electricity instead of gas. Well, the CNG Honda Civic is a hundred times more environmentally friendly on its worst day.</p>\n<p>Why? The plants that produce the electricity used in a hybrid must burn oil, coal, or use a nuclear reaction to provide it. CNG comes from the ground and is easier to drill for than oil, so does not impact the Earth as much during extraction. A CNG vehicle&#8217;s carbon footprints is the size of an ant&#8217;s next to a hybrid&#8217;s. The Civic Natural Gas vehicle is the cleanest-running internal combustion engine ever certified by the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>\n<p>What about fuel economy you may ask. How about a Honda Civic that offers 38 mpg and 240 miles between fill ups? Not bad at all. Then there is the time it takes to refuel. Minutes for a CNG Civic. How many hours for your plug-in hybrid or EV? Hours, isn&#8217;t it?</p>\n<p>Now the other shoe falls. There is a decided lack of infrastructure for the CNG Civic. Refueling stations are rare, even more rare than commercial recharge stations for electric vehicles. A CNG refueling point costs more to install than a traditional gas station, as well. The federal government is considering offering companies incentives and funds to develop CNG infrastructure. The end goal of some investors is to see CNG points next to traditional gas pumps, just like diesel is today.</p>\n<p>The Honda Civic CNG was introduced in 1998. Honda has sold few vehicles to the general public, but has enjoyed limited success with municipal fleets. The car was awarded the 2012 Green Car of the Year Award. Hopefully, the added attention will hep to bring the vehicle more into the mainstream.</p>\n",

Critics express their displeasure with words and buyers have been expressing their displeasure by not buying Civics. During an interview at the Tokyo Motor Show, Honda CEO Takanobu Ito accepted responsibility for the poor performance of the Civic and vowed that his company would improve the car in the very near future.</p>\n<p>U.S. sales of the Honda Civic are down 14.8% from last year&#8217;s mark, through the first ten months of 2011. Granted, inventory levels were down due to the twin disasters in Japan, but the Civic is showing no signs of life now that inventory levels are close to pre-disaster levels. Given that caveat, Honda&#8217;s design team admits dropping the ball and that the Civic&#8217;s current design is &#8221;dull and uninspiring.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Honda creative director Yoshinori Asahi was recently quoted as saying,&#8221; In the past few years the cars have been a bit boring.&#8221; Ito attempted to explain the lack of new design features by blaming market research that indicated Americans would accept more cheaply made cars during the recent recession, if they were fuel efficient. The company should seriously consider firing the group that performed that market research and examine their own inability to consider that the economy could turnaround before the <a href=\"http://hondacivicblog.com/archives/2012-civic-finds-itself-in-a-different-world\">2012 Civic</a> hit dealer&#8217;s lots.</p>\n<p>Honda is hinting at a dramatic change for mid-cycle in 2013. A near complete redesign was scheduled for 2014, but sales for the Civic are so low and complaints so common that Honda has bumped that up a year. American Honda President John Mendel said that the company has been &#8221; appropriately energized&#8221; to update and revamp the Civic.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_358\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-358\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://hondacivicblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/800px-CivicRS.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-358\" title=\"800px-CivicRS\" src=\"http://www.harostreetmedia.net/hondacivicblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2011/12/800px-CivicRS-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https://hondacivicblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/800px-CivicRS-300x225.jpg 300w, https://hondacivicblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/800px-CivicRS-768x576.jpg 768w, https://hondacivicblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/800px-CivicRS.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-358\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">1973 Honda Civic RS</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The 2012 Honda Civic is being further crippled by its competitors.

Several factors, dating back to 2008, have compiled to keep the resale value of several Honda offerings, especially the Civic, at record levels. Some are still able to command close to their original MSRP.</p>\n<p>The first factor was the economic downturn that began in 2008. Potential buyers found themselves needing to hold on to their cars longer due to job loss or being afraid of a layoff. That slowly led to an absence of quality used cars on dealer&#8217;s lots. The trend of holding onto cars continued through late 2010.</p>\n<p>In March of 2011 the twin disasters of an earthquake and tsunami devastated the automotive industry in Japan. With several of the major players, including Honda, unable to produce sufficient numbers of new fuel efficient cars, buyers either turned to other automakers or bought used cars. This further strained the dwindling supply of used cars, driving a sharp uptick in the resale value of fuel efficient cars like the Honda Civic.</p>\n<p>By the second quarter of 2011, many people were tired of waiting to buy a new car and sales increased. Unfortunately, many of these people were trading in cars that were over five years old or not fuel efficient. This left plenty of undesirable cars on the used market, but fuel efficient cars were still in shorter supply than many people would like, driving resale values even higher.</p>\n<p>As a result of all of these factors, the resale value of a used Honda Civic can be nearly as high as its original selling price. Resale values are currently 30% higher than they were in 2008. This situation will reverse itself as the supply of fuel efficient new cars returns to normal. Honda predicts that it will be back at pre-disaster supply levels by March, 2012. When that happens, the average price of a three to five year old used Honda Civic should drop quickly.</p>\n",

While detractors have said many things about the Civic, its mpg rating has never been an issue. Still, it can be improved with a few relatively inexpensive items. Here are three aftermarket parts that will help you stretch your fuel dollar.</p>\n<p>The least expensive item that you can possible buy to improve the mpg of your Honda Civic is a tire gauge. Sound ridiculous? Maybe, but over or under inflated tires have been proven to rob as much as 15% of a vehicle&#8217;s fuel efficiency. That can mean around five fewer miles per gallon in a typical Civic. Take into account the excessive wear on your tires and you can see how a $4 tire gauge could save you hundreds of dollars per year.</p>\n<p>The next part is very simple as well. A new air filter allows increased air flow to the combustion chambers. By having more oxygen available, you Civic will use less fuel, the cylinders will fire more efficiently, and you can add another 5-10% fuel efficiency. These parts can cost about $10 each. There are performance filters from K&amp;N and other companies that can be cleaned and reused for several years, saving you even more money.</p>\n<p>Another way to improve fuel efficiency is to stabilize your Civic&#8217;s voltage system. A voltage tuning system offers several benefits including: low, mid, and high rev performance, increased horsepower, more torque, and throttle response all of which lead to better fuel economy through efficient throttle position sensing.</p>\n<p>With an automatic transmission the <a href=\"http://hondacivicblog.com/archives/2012-civic-finds-itself-in-a-different-world\">2012 Honda Civic</a> is rated to get 28 mpg city and 39 mpg on the highway. You can add all of these parts for less than $350. Once they are in place, you could see your Civic&#8217;s mpg jump to 45 or higher on the highway. Spread those savings out over the lifetime of your car and you can see that the parts more than pay for themselves.</p>\n",

When you are car shopping, it is essential to know the correct value of the car that you are considering before signing any deal. The logical combination of the two is a mobile app to help you find the right price for a Honda Civic or any other vehicle. Here are three auto value mobile apps compared apples to apples.</p>\n<p><strong>Edmunds Mobile</strong></p>\n<p>We might as well start with one of the most recognizable names in the automotive review and value game. The app is actually called Inside Line, it allows iPhone and Android users to research new and used cars for value, safety, and current pricing levels. This free app allows you access to the True Market Value for your region. That means the price on the screen is directly relevant to your state or city in some cases. Several users have complained about the limited number of cars that are reviewed by this app.</p>\n<p><strong>Kelley Blue Book</strong></p>\n<p>Kelley Blue Book is probably the most recognizable name in the automotive value game. The company has been doing its thing for nearly 100 years. The KBB Mobile app is supported on the iPhone, Android, or most mobile browser platforms. The app gives you full access to all information on kbb.com. This app costs everyone&#8217;s favorite price: free.</p>\n<p><strong>Cars.com</strong></p>\n<p>This is another free app, because, well, why pay for the services these apps offer. This app stacks up third on the list. It does have one interesting feature: the ability to add your &#8221;possibilities&#8221; to a list and rank them according to your likes. You can add a photo of a car if you see an interesting feature that makes you want to buy it more than others on your list.</p>\n<p>Of the three, the Kelley Blue Book app offers the widest range of information on the greatest number of possible cars. Since the only way to get a good deal on a car is to have access to an accurate value, this is probably the best app to download. It could save you thousands of dollars over the life of an average loan.</p>\n",

An all new Honda Civic hybrid was mentioned as well as a plug-in hybrid concept that would hopefully make it into production for the 2012 model year. Here is a quick glance at the most recent information about both.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://hondacivicblog.com/archives/honda-civic-is-stable-in-providing-the-new-evolutions-of-its-not-aging-bestseller\">2012 Honda Civic Hybrid</a> offers a 1.5L four cylinder hybrid engine that delivers 44 mpg in the city or on the highway with the help of the continuously variable transmission. The 2012 also features standard stability control, traction control, and side/curtain airbags. The base model adds 15-inch alloy wheels and low-rolling-resistance tires, outside mirrors with built-in turn signals, LED taillights, a rear spoiler and a 160-watt, six-speaker stereo. The &#8221;Leather&#8221; trim level adds heated mirrors, leather upholstery, and heated front seats.</p>\n<p>The plug-in is still a work in progress. Honda&#8217;s official site for the vehicle lists several expected aspects, but not an official announcement of whether it will be a CR-Z or Civic platform based vehicle. The plug-in hybrid platform will allow for short, frequent trips in all-electric mode. Long distance trips will be powered by Honda&#8217;s 2.0-liter, i-VTEC inline 4 popper. The finalized incarnation will continuously move through three modes for maximum driving efficiency: all-electric, gasoline-electric and an engine direct-drive mode. The direct-drive mode allows the engine to drive the front wheels directly for better fuel efficiency at cruising speeds in excess of 62 mph. The platform&#8217;s all electric range will offer a top effective distance of 15 miles at 62 mph or less. Recharge time is going to be in the 2 hour neighborhood with a household 120V outlet or 1 hour with a a 240V plug.</p>\n<p>The Honda Civic is facing stiffer competition this year. Kia and Hyundai are offering less expensive vehicles that are very comparable in options, safety, and fuel efficiency. There is a general urgency at Honda to develop improved engines to combat this competition. This all bodes well for the cash strapped general populace.</p>\n",

Winter is breathing down the necks of people everywhere. That means white powder everywhere. It also means slush, road salt, and general wet nastiness in your Honda Civic. All of it can destroy an interior over time unless you add a few practical accessories to <a href=\"http://hondacivicblog.com/archives/winter-car-tips\">protect your ride</a>.</p>\n<p>The first practical part to consider is a set of all weather floor mats. These mats are designed from durable plastic with channels so that water and other mess are pooled in a drainage area. The mat can then be lifted out of your foot box area and drained without ever letting a mess touch your Civic&#8217;s carpet. Along the same line is a cargo mat for your trunk area. A poorly maintained interior is a major detractor when you try to resell your car and can lower its value by several hundred if not a couple of thousand dollars. Before you buy either of these accessories, be sure to do some internet research. Companies like WeatherTech and Husky offer all weather products that are specifically designed for the Honda Civic, insuring a proper fit that does not interfere with pedal use.</p>\n<p>One area of the interior that is often overlooked is the seats. You are constantly rubbing across them, but ignoring the effects that friction, zippers, and other materials can have on them. Ignoring them until a tear happens, that is. A set of seat covers could be the best solution. Whether you prefer neoprene or the look and feel of leather that leatherette provides, you need to take care to buy a product that is designed for your Honda Civic. Generic fit brands may cause the seat cover to bunch or just be too tight to fit correctly.</p>\n<p>One last Honda Civic accessory to consider is a remote start. Installing a remote start has nothing to do with being too lazy to walk out to your car. It has everything with wanting to get into a warm vehicle first thing in the morning. Just remember to leave the heat running when you shut your car down for the night.</p>\n<p>With snow in the immediate forecast in several areas of North America, now is the time to start <a href=\"http://hondacivicblog.com/archives/winter-car-tips\">thinking about your Civic&#8217;s</a> interior and future resale value. A quick look online will lead you to the right products for your car.</p>\n",

Styling may not set it apart from many cars, but its reputation for fuel efficiency, durability, and reliability have helped it stand out from most cars on the market today. It is also a favorite for tuners, backyard and professional alike. There are hundreds of Honda Civic parts that you can choose from to customize your car, but here are three that offer performance in several ways.</p>\n<p>In a previous post, <a href=\"http://hondacivicblog.com/archives/what-to-look-for-in-a-honda-civic-lowering-kit\">lowering kits </a>were covered. They are great for additional handling and a faster take off by reducing squat on acceleration, but are limited when standing alone. Try adding a carbon fiber hood as well. These hoods offer a 50 lb weight reduction, which offers a faster 0-60 and a little extra at the top end. Seibon is probably the best known manufacturer, but Carbon Creations, and VIS Racing offer solid products as well. There are other weight reduction options, but a carbon fiber hood is an easy project for do-it-yourselfers at any level. While you are looking at a carbon hood, why not look into a replacement hatch or trunk lid for additional weight reduction?</p>\n<p>This project is a little more involved and doesn&#8217;t really add anything other than a cool factor. Vertical doors for you Honda Civic will really help your ride stand out in a crowd. There can be some welding involved, but the basic parts are all included in the kit. Hey, if a Lambo can have them, why not your Honda Civic?</p>\n<p>The next project should be designed to reduce the aerodynamic drag of your Honda Civic. Body kits are in order. Spoilers, replacement grilles, under bumper spoilers, the list goes on. Lowering the drag your car experiences can add top speed and offer improved handling.</p>\n<p>If you make all of the changes mentioned in this post, you could see an additional 50 horsepower from your car, a shorter time in the quarter, and a faster mile. Additionally, your handling will improve, allowing you to perform better in slalom type events or just weaving through traffic. Good luck with your projects.</p>\n",

There are many places that you could start your project, but a lowering kit offers enhanced performance in handling and fuel efficiency. Unfortunately, not all Honda Civic lowering kits are created equally. Buying the wrong kit can have the disappointing effect of decreasing your car&#8217;s performance. Here are is the main point to look for in any kit before you purchase one.</p>\n<p>The amount of travel that the lowering kit allows directly affects how much roll you experience in turns, thus affecting handling. The kit that you choose should only allow 1 inch of travel. Additional travel will cause your car to bottom out, anything less will not positively affect your car&#8217;s performance. After installing your lowering kit, you will need to have your car realigned. The lower center of gravity will throw off the suspension geometry of your car.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that a lowering kit will not completely optimize your Civic&#8217;s handling. In addition to lowering your car, you may want to consider adding front and rear sway bars, strut tower braces, or a two point under carriage brace. All of these parts are designed to help reduce squat during acceleration and roll turning a turn. None of these parts add noticeable weight to your car. One final part that can be overlooked is a larger set of tires. Adding one or two sizes to the standard tires can close any remaining gap between the tire and the wheel well of your Civic.</p>\n<p>Adding a lowering kit to your <a href=\"http://hondacivicblog.com/archives/civic-type-r-performance-for-the-budget-minded-schumachers\">Honda Civic</a> is not a beginner level upgrade. Any time you change the suspension of your car, you can create a dangerous situation for yourself. Take care to have an expert install any of these parts. When you are finished you should be able to notice an additional 15% in fuel efficiency and a quicker time on the short track as well as any slalom type event. All of that and no one has mentioned weight reduction yet.</p>\n",

This ever-popular car has to face much stronger opposition than ever before.</p>\n<p>Here is what is actually happening at the moment. Let’s say 10 years ago there were surely other offers in this segment of compact, fuel efficient cars, selling for under $20000. Besides Civics’ strongest rival – Toyota Corolla, there were just no matches from Korean or American manufacturers. The Koreans haven’t gotten there yet and the American car manufacturers, who traditionally shined in the full-size part of the market, did not do too well in the department of the compact and fuel – efficient cars.</p>\n<p>Well the times have changed. Now, Kia and Hyundai have fine cars to sell, and so do the American car manufacturers.  They all now <a href=\"http://hondacivicblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/2012Civic2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-291\" title=\"2012Civic2\" src=\"http://www.harostreetmedia.net/hondacivicblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2011/07/2012Civic2-300x199.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"199\" srcset=\"https://hondacivicblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/2012Civic2-300x199.jpg 300w, https://hondacivicblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/2012Civic2-768x510.jpg 768w, https://hondacivicblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/2012Civic2.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a>produce consistently impressive cars in the sub-$20K range, the build quality and look of which match or even beat Honda. Well, think for yourself, in all honesty, a world in which the Chevy Cruze or Ford Focus match up against a Civic is truly a different world.</p>\n<p>Now what does the new Civic has to put up against its rivals? It continues to be a compact and presently futuristically shaped car and it can also come in a form of a hybrid or be powered by natural gas. The car that uses regular fuel has fuel efficiency that matches that of regular hybrids (36 mpg highway), while the Civic hybrid is rated at 44 mpg, which is an outstanding result in my opinion.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hondacivicblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/2012Civic3.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-292 alignleft\" title=\"2012Civic3\" src=\"http://www.harostreetmedia.net/hondacivicblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2011/07/2012Civic3-300x199.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"199\" /></a>So, considering the rather fierce competition, Civic continues to be a nice machine, however it no longer is the only one of a kind.

It continues to lead studies and experiment with hydrogen technologies, electricity-powered engines and its biofuel cars.</p>\n<p>The especial breakthrough in this field was the introduction, in September 2006 of Flex Fuel Vehicle (FFV), using the platform of Civic. The Civic FFV is unique in the sense that it is capable of operating on both E-85, the already available bio-fuel in the US, Sweden, Finland and to a very limited degree in Canada and on 100% ethanol, used far and wide in Brazil. The concept is not new in any way; however it is the Honda’s advanced research and production capabilities that make this vehicle so adaptive to varying fuel mixtures, and ambient temperature changes. FFV&#8217;s made in the US are currently setup to run on straight E85, straight gasoline, or any ratio of both fuel types. Honda is introducing an FFV into the Brazilian automobile market suited to run on a much higher blend of ethanol &#8211; E20 to E100.</p>\n<p>The challenge here is to eventually achieve comparable performance and economy from E100, as from petroleum based gasoline.

And yet Honda manages to fix this problem, by introducing a secondary, gasoline fuel tank. The new Honda ethanol fuel feeder adapts to varying ethanol to gasoline ratios measuring the concentration of ethanol in the tank via time exhaust measurements.</p>\n<p>Well, here is the deal. Ethanol, also known by the name of biofuel, is made from feed stocks such as sugar cane and corn. Thus using biofuel does not much increase the atmospheric CO2 and makes the ethanol an effective alternative to fossil fuel. And yet it is the government that has to make use of biofuel more attractive, by dropping the prices, so that cars, such as Honda Civic FFV would be bought not only by the smart people concerned about reducing the carbon footprint, but also by the majority of the population thinking of saving a dollar here and a dollar there. So let’s hope for that!</p>\n",

There are lots of them that people use to get from point A to point B; different generations and in different shapes – some are shining and proudly showing off their body-lines, others eaten by the rust from the ground up.<br />\nBut there is one thing that has always made Hondas stand from the crowd of similar Toyotas, Nissans, and countless Korean makes presently storming the market, and it is their engines. Tracing their heritage to the car and motorcycle racing, Honda continues to design its engines being more performance oriented, comparing to the other fellow Asian opponents.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It’s interesting that it is a rather common practice to use Honda’s souped-up engines in building one of a kind concept cars or racing <a href=\"http://hondacivicblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/4.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-276\" title=\"4\" src=\"http://www.harostreetmedia.net/hondacivicblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2011/06/4-300x196.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"196\" /></a>fireballs. Have a look at the following example of this phenomenon.</p>\n<p>What you see here is called Ariel Atom – which is nothing, but a student project of Nick Smart from the University of Coventry. This concept car is built around Honda Civic Type R power train and is ready to be driven on the common highways, though it doesn’t have the doors, or windows, neither stereo system or air conditioning.</p>\n<p>I wonder, if you had asked yourself a question, as to why so many boutique companies that are capable of coming up with rare and exceptional sports cars choose the easy way and equip their creations with already known and widely used engines bought from the mainline manufacturers? Why in stead of coming up with an exclusive multi-cylinder engine, they instead weld together two Volkswagen V6s, for example?</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hondacivicblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/3.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-277\" title=\"3\" src=\"http://www.harostreetmedia.net/hondacivicblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2011/06/3-300x213.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"213\" /></a>And the answer to this is the resource and reliability of a well tested and time-proven engine that can not be beaten by exclusive, newly designed prototype engines. The same goes true in the case of the Ariel Atom – Honda’s Civic Type R engine has all the muscles, reliability and the output one may want, with none of the hassles. This popularized creation of the engineering craftsmanship produces 245 horse powers and 218 N·m of torque at 7,000 r/pm, utilizing Mugen parts, namely camshafts, exhaust and ECU. All this power derived from Honda’s engine allows Atom to reach 60 mph in just 2.9 s, with the maximum speed of 225 km/h.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">So regardless what would be the choice of the prospective buyer – a fast and furious Civic or Accord Type R, a supercharged Honda-powered Atom, or a reliable and socially acceptable Civic, with Honda engines one can never go wrong!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hondacivicblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-274 aligncenter\" title=\"1\" src=\"http://www.harostreetmedia.net/hondacivicblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2011/06/1-300x202.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"202\" /></a></p>\n",

Honda purposefully chose not to announce any engine details for the new model, but one could safely conclude that if will be a four-cylinder engine line, which will definitely include a base version and a higher-charged option for the sportier Si trim.

But is the bad at all? I reminded of the success of the American classic 18 wheelers or the Harley Davidson motorcycles, which continue to stay on their path, perfecting what they already know is the best in its class. Dimensions are close to those of the vehicle currently in production. The suspension retains the familiar MacPherson struts in the front and a multilink setup for the rear.</p>\n<p>And finally, the answer that is of interest to all the prospective buyers of the new Civics. The base pricing should be match closely with the current car&#8217;s price of $16,355 for the coupe and $16,555 for the sedan. So, whose will it be?</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hondacivicblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/7-civic.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-264\" title=\"7-civic\" src=\"http://www.harostreetmedia.net/hondacivicblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2011/06/7-civic-300x180.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"180\" srcset=\"https://hondacivicblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/7-civic-300x180.jpg 300w, https://hondacivicblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/7-civic.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

So does the 2010 Honda  Civic Hybrid – it delivers what it promises &#8211; taking you any place with  superb fuel efficiency. As you probably know, the four-door Hybrid takes  advantage of the blend of gasoline and electric power to give you an  unbeatable 45 mpg, not only to save your money, but to truly take care  of the environment. At a price starting from $23,800, the Hybrid enters  the ring to compete with the VW Jetta TDI, the Civic GX running on  natural gas, and of course the new Toyota Prius hybrid.</p>\n<p>The system used in the 2010 Hybrid boasts 5 various modes to let the  electrics and gas engine co-work. Theoretically the Hybrid is capable  of running on electric power alone, but you would be surprised to see it  for any noticeable time span. The engine is a 93-horsepower 1.3-liter  powertrain especially suitable for working together with the hybrid  system. It is assisted in its task by a 20-horsepower electric motor.</p>\n<p>Some of the expert reviewers have already tried the new 2010 Civic  Hybrid on the road. Like all the other Civics, it behaves extremely well  in the domain of handling, making relaxed driving a dream. But some of  the complaints were that the steering felt somewhat numb and not overly  responsive, and that the gasoline engine has to rev at high speeds when  the situation calls for it. However cruising around town at moderate  speeds is pleasurable, with only electric power engaged at times.</p>\n<p>To sum it all up, the 2010 Honda Civic Hybrid presents a real and  tried way to reduce your fuel expenses, in the same time not showing off  your green credentials to everyone. And as a tip for potential buyers,  the all new 2010 Honda Civic Hybrid sedan is virtually unchanged from  the previous year model, so you may as well save your money on a lightly  used model from 2009.</p>\n",

Out of the total number only 2,010 units will make it to the Japanese market.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-241 aligncenter\" title=\"Honda Civic - Type R Euro\" src=\"http://hondacivicblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/eurofrontside1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"458\" height=\"304\" srcset=\"https://hondacivicblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/eurofrontside1.jpg 566w, https://hondacivicblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/eurofrontside1-300x199.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 458px) 100vw, 458px\" /></p>\n<p>The fans don’t cease comparing the actual Type R to Type R Euro wondering whether “European made” necessarily means better. The major difference is the use of a twist-beam rear suspension on Euro Type R vs. a fully independent suspension on the Japanese made Type-R. But regardless of the individual preferences both of the modification are fine rides with a top speed of around 146 miles/hour capable of reaching 60 miles in just 6.5 seconds.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><a href=\"http://hondacivicblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/euroside1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-244\" title=\"Honda Civic Type R - Euro, Side view\" src=\"http://hondacivicblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/euroside1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"453\" height=\"222\" srcset=\"https://hondacivicblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/euroside1.jpg 566w, https://hondacivicblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/euroside1-300x147.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 453px) 100vw, 453px\" /></a></p>\n<p>The new Civic Type R Euro comes equipped with a 2.0 L naturally aspirated engine able to put out a maximum of 201hp/ 7,800rpm that works in pair with a 6-speed manual transmission. It is the DOHC i-VTEC known for its higher compression, secondary balancer serving to reduce vibration, but most notable for high revs and high output.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><a href=\"http://hondacivicblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/euroenginebay1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-246\" title=\"Honda Civic Type R Euro Engine bay\" src=\"http://hondacivicblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/euroenginebay1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"453\" height=\"302\" srcset=\"https://hondacivicblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/euroenginebay1.jpg 566w, https://hondacivicblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/euroenginebay1-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 453px) 100vw, 453px\" /></a></p>\n<p>And unlike some of the Japanese makes which often times got criticism for inexpressive design Type R Euro has the style to match its capabilities. It comes with a lighter drop dead gorgeous body on 18-inch wheels. And beyond any doubt Type R Euro has all the add-ons such as custom aerodynamic spoilers, smaller three-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel, and aluminum ball knob of a shift lever à la Ferrari.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><a href=\"http://hondacivicblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/eurocockpit1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-248\" title=\"Honda Civic Type R - Euro Cockpit\" src=\"http://hondacivicblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/eurocockpit1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"453\" height=\"322\" srcset=\"https://hondacivicblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/eurocockpit1.jpg 566w, https://hondacivicblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/eurocockpit1-300x213.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 453px) 100vw, 453px\" /></a></p>\n<p>And besides giving one unparalleled satisfaction of superior performance on the road, it also looks out for its driver and the environment.

This extreme version of the popular Civic comes loaded with features to create a driving experience like nothing else.</p>\n<p>It makes a statement with its stunning original styling: sitting low to the ground showing off its seductive and yet aggressive lines, with a black mesh grille setting the tone for performance.<br />\nIt looks smart and brings to mind the long years of victories of Honda in racing competitions. Moreover, in 2008 Type R won the 2008 Wheels Automotive Design Award outclassing some of the very serious competitors, such as Audi R8 and TT; Saab 9-3 Cabrio and VW Eos.</p>\n<p>And it does have plenty of power to back up its looks. It comes equipped with a powerful 2.0 liter engine with i-VTEC variable timing controlled via a fully electronic throttle system producing 201 hp and 193 Nm of torque at 5600 rpm. The close-ratio gearbox helps effectively transform all the output into the thrust sufficient to race through time and space. In addition an advanced Limited Slip Differential (LSD) helps it maximize traction and prevent wheel slip during tight turns.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-235\" title=\"Civic Type R - Interior\" src=\"http://hondacivicblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/typeR-interior-400px.jpg\" alt=\"Civic Type R - Interior\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://hondacivicblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/typeR-interior-400px.jpg 400w, https://hondacivicblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/typeR-interior-400px-300x225.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" /></p>\n<p>To sum it all up, the Civic Type R drives as good as it looks, with a handling capability that very few cars in this category can match. Its tight suspension builds emotional involvement from your part, making the process of negotiating the curbs a dream that so many folks are after. And all of that for only 9.3 liters per 100km &#8211; a number that looks very well comparing to the similar-sized cars which are not built for racing performance. So why look anywhere else, when Type-R is the way to pump in plenty of adrenaline without going financially broke?</p>\n",

This is the prognosis of the executive director of Honda Tzuneo Tanai as expressed in his interview to Automotive News.<br />\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-227\" title=\"civic 1\" src=\"http://www.harostreetmedia.net/hondacivicblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2009/12/civic-1-300x171.jpg\" alt=\"civic 1\" width=\"300\" height=\"171\" /><br />\nAccording to Tzuneo, the initial plan was that Civic was to be larger and more expensive than its predecessor, however after the thorough analysis of prognosis of prices for oil products, rolled metal products and other types of raw materials the decision was made to bring modifications to the project. Now the new model is aimed to become more compact, lighter and more fuel efficient. Besides that, the new Honda Civic platform will be initially adopted for the use of a hybrid power-train.</p>\n<p>It is good to keep in mind that Civic platform is widely used  by Honda Motor company and serves the basis for other models, such as crossovers  CR-V and HR-V, a minivan Stream, and a compact FR-V. Presently Civic comes as hatchback, sedan and a coupe.</p>\n<p>Honda’s new CEO Takanobu Ito states that the Japanese auto giant is “taking sufficient time to redesign the new Civic as well as all the other models”. Honda seeks way to make most of the research possibilities and seeks to comply with the possible changes in the environment. Honda is committed to reducing the size of its highly successful Civic model, but assures that the interior space and a sense of roominess will not decrease. A new futuristic Civic!? Why not!</p>\n",

Honda fans have always been fond of the hot-tempered power trains employing racing technologies that Honda was famous for.<br />\nWell let’s look at all the new upgrades. The main distinction is that now Civic has a 5-step automatic transmission in stead of former 6-step robotized gear box. This transmission is very basic, has the low sectors like “D3”, “2”, and “1”, but no “sport” or manual modes.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-222\" style=\"margin-right: 10px\" title=\"civic front\" src=\"http://www.harostreetmedia.net/hondacivicblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2009/11/civic-front-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"civic front\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https://hondacivicblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/civic-front-300x225.jpg 300w, https://hondacivicblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/civic-front.jpg 588w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" />An upgrade from the side of power trains is that the basic engine – 1.4 l (95 hp) is a little cleaner with 12 hp greater output. A 1.8 engine with the output of 140 hp continues to be the sought after modification. Trying it on the roads it soon becomes obvious that hat this engine performs more than adequately in all the situations. But one would not go bananas over the way the vehicle with automatic transmission accelerates. The steps of the automatic gear box are outstretched – you may reach the speed of 37 miles per hour on the first gear, 65 on the second, and 105 on the third.<br />\nWith all that said, the handling for the Civic is above reproach. It follows fanatically all the slightest turns of the steering wheel, and the higher the speed is, the greater confidence Honda gives you of the fact that you are in control. The precise neutral cornering ability makes negotiating curbs a dream! It is just a little stiffer then the previous Civic even though the dealers affirm that the suspension hasn’t undergone any changes. It could be that the replacement of the robotized transmission with the automatic one added the additional 118 lbs to the front of the car….<br />\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-223\" title=\"civic side\" src=\"http://hondacivicblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/civic-side.jpg\" alt=\"civic side\" width=\"433\" height=\"280\" srcset=\"https://hondacivicblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/civic-side.jpg 433w, https://hondacivicblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/civic-side-300x194.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 433px) 100vw, 433px\" /></p>\n<p>The interior is dead silent. New weather strips keep the road noise down. VDC stabilization assistance system engages itself only in extreme situations, allowing for some sweet wheel slip.</p>\n<p>To sum it all up – the new restyled and modernized Civic is roughly 4 % more expensive than its predecessor. There is certainly no doubt that the automatic transmission will perform well. But if it was for us to decide, we would pass the offer on both robotized and automatic transmissions, as the real Honda should come with a stick.</p>\n",

Honda continues to present a winning combination, which truly makes Civic a leader in its class, both for style and reliability. Its fuel efficiency pleases the frugal minded folk, but equally makes sense to all the people watching the gas prices closely.</p>\n<p>The new 2010 model comes virtually unchanged, as the 2009 Civic was selected “Best Buy” by the Consumer Guide. So if the 2010 model is essentially the very same thing, one may consider buying a 2009 model and saving some dough. You can actually get a pretty good deal, as the dealers are eager to get the 2009 models of their lots.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-204 alignleft\" style=\"margin-left: 10px;margin-right: 10px\" title=\"2010 Honda Civic Interior\" src=\"http://www.harostreetmedia.net/hondacivicblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2009/11/civic-interior-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"2010 Honda Civic Interior\" width=\"240\" height=\"160\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-205 aligncenter\" title=\"Honda Civic Rear Quarter View\" src=\"http://www.harostreetmedia.net/hondacivicblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2009/11/civic-rear-quarter-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Honda Civic Rear Quarter View\" width=\"240\" height=\"160\" /></p>\n<p>Despite the outstanding reliability, and fuel economy the 2009 and 2010 Civics have received some harsh comments. The main dispute was its exterior, particularly the snub-nose and a rather odd minivan-like windshield. Some commented that the design was just uninteresting, “you could drive and not notice a half of dozen of Civics on your way to work.” Others criticized the dual-tiered instrument as overburdened and mesmerizing.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-206\" style=\"margin-left: 10px;margin-right: 10px\" title=\"2010 Honda Civic 4 door\" src=\"http://www.harostreetmedia.net/hondacivicblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2009/11/civic-4door-front-quarter-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"2010 Honda Civic 4 door\" width=\"240\" height=\"160\" /></p>\n<p>But can all of this really be a major drawback when we are talking about the unparalleled quality and solid reputation for quality? The engineering of Civic is as strong for the 2010 model as ever and they have always held their resale value well. The car has a truly dynamic performance combined with the fuel-sipping manners –setting a standard in the highly competitive compact cars class. In addition, Civic boasts excellent safety scores in both federal government and insurance industry, and comes equipped with anti-lock brakes and six airbags!</p>\n<p>However, making your mind to buy a Civic is the easy part. What’s difficult is choosing the one that is right for you. The basic Civic is either a sedan or coupe and it comes in different trims such as DX, LX, LX-S, EX with the price range from roughly $15,500 to all the way up to $22,000. The Honda Civic SI boasts increased performance-oriented trim, with 57 extra horsepower, pushing the price up to extra $6,500. The other interesting options are Civic Hybrid with the prices of about $10,000 higher than for a base Civic, and the Civic GX which runs on compressed natural gas.</p>\n",

In fact, Civics are so indestructible, that the model my parents drove me home from the hospital in as a newborn was the first car I drove 16 years later when I got my license. It was still running fine one year later when we drove it to the local junkyard, my father opting to retire it before it started to fall apart – but who knows when that would have been? Oh, and we replaced it with another Civic.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"attachment wp-att-189 alignright\" style=\"margin-left:10px\" src=\"http://www.harostreetmedia.net/hondacivicblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2009/03/2000hondacivic4856-300x189.thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"2000 Honda Civic Coupe Si\" width=\"200\" height=\"126\" />There are countless worthy years and models to choose from when buying a <a href=\"http://www.autohound.ca/Ontario/GTA%20Region/Toronto/Honda/Civic/default.aspx?key=422306\">used Honda Civic</a>, with many online sites, like AutoHound, AutoHopper and AutoTrander, offering competitive deals. However, in the long and esteemed history of the Civic there are two models that truly stand out in terms of style, fuel efficiency, and engine power: the 2006 Sedan Hybrid and the 2000 Coupe Si.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"attachment wp-att-190 alignleft\" style=\"margin-right: 10px\" src=\"http://www.harostreetmedia.net/hondacivicblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2009/03/2006_honda_civichybrid_ext_1.thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"2006 Honda Civic Hybrid\" width=\"200\" height=\"129\" />The <a href=\"http://www.autobytel.com/content/shared/articles/templates/index.cfm/article_id_int/2556\">2006 Honda Civic Sedan Hybrid</a> is part of the newest generation of Civics, and conservatively claims it can reach up to 42 mpg – some experts actually put output at 50 mpg. Like all models built after 2005, the Hybrid features the redesigned hood and windshield design, as well as improved dashboard gauges that make the driver feel they are actually in the cockpit of a space-ready hovercraft instead of a Civic. It is powered by a four cylinder engine that works seamlessly with an electric component to provide 110 horsepower. Not everyone will like the redesigned interior or loss of engine power, and not enough time has passed to really gauge the lifespan of the hybrid engine. So when purchasing a 2006 Hybrid, don’t settle for anything more than 45,000 miles – just to be safe.</p>\n<p>It is hard to go wrong with the 2000 Honda Civic Coupe Si, a sturdy little car that consistently hits 25 mpg. The Si was reintroduced to Honda lovers in the second half of 1999 and features 160 horsepower from a 1.6 liter VTEC engine. The 2000 Si is visually updated from previous Si models through the addition of spoilers, 15-inch alloy wheels, and side graphics. Air condition, CD players, keyless entry, and power doors and windows are also included features on this model. Like most Hondas, this model is worthwhile up to 100,000 miles, and costs around $7,000.</p>\n<p>The bottom line is that when you are looking to purchase a used car, it is hard to beat the quality, lasting performance, and reliability of a Civic – unless the competition is the equally as worthwhile Honda Accord.</p>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/pixy.gif\" alt=\"\" /><span class=\"zem-script more-related\"></span></div>\n",

This is the second warning sent out from Honda regarding the faulty Handbrake problem on the Civic with the initial warning going out in the fourth quarter of 2007.</p>\n<p>In a nutshell, the problem lies inside the handbrake assembly and a key &#8216;spring&#8217; was mounted backwards. The problem manifests itself such that if the handbrake is applied while holding down the release button (no ratcheting) it has a high propensity to NOT engage properly. 29 complaints from owners prompted the notifications.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hondacivicblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/handbrake2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-76\" title=\"2006 Honda Civic Handbrake\" src=\"http://www.harostreetmedia.net/hondacivicblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2008/06/handbrake2-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https://hondacivicblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/handbrake2-300x225.jpg 300w, https://hondacivicblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/handbrake2.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></p>\n<p>(image from paultan.org)</p>\n<p>Despite the fact that Honda is offering all affected owners a replacement handbrake at no charge, they are still not calling this a recall. According to the company, it isn&#8217;t a recall because the problem will not occur  if the handbrake is operated within the guidelines described in the users manual.</p>\n<p>A Honda spokesman had this to say &#8220;As it stands, there is only a tiny chance of the handbrake failing if it is incorrectly applied. However, to give owners 100% peace of mind, we will be sending out letters recommending that they visit their local Honda dealer to get an improved handbrake fitted.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Official Bulletin from Honda to dealers about the issue:</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>\n<p>In November 2007 bulletin HUK00000001050 was issued highlighting a potential concern with the handbrake fitted to 06/07YM Civic 3/5 door. We are now in a position to launch an official PUD to replace the handbrake lever on all affected Civics within the VIN range. A phased customer mailing will start the week commencing 7 April. An initial stock of handbrake levers will be automatically supplied to all sales dealers. <strong>Please note that there is still not 100% parts availability so when the initial stock has been used please only order new parts in quantities actually required.</strong> The first mailings will prioritise those Civics affected by both the drivers door latch and handbrake PUD&#8217;s. A copy of both customer letters are attached to this bulletin.</p>\n<p>Not all Civic VINs will require this PUD, those Civics which have had the latest level handbrake lever already fitted (08YM part) will have been removed from the PUD database. Therefore please use Campaign for a VIN/PIN to verify that the vehicle is outstanding for this PUD.</p>\n<p><strong>Symptom</strong></p>\n<p>If the handbrake is applied with the release button intentionally or unintentionally pressed there is a small risk that the handbrake may not latch sufficiently to hold the vehicle securely on a gradient. If the handbrake is applied without touching the release button, the handbrake latching mechanism is unaffected.</p>\n<p><strong>Cause</strong></p>\n<p>Due to ratchet and pawl dimensions, the handbrake latching mechanism may partially engage depending upon customers&#8217; operating method.</p>\n<p><strong>Countermeasure</strong></p>\n<p>The handbrake latching mechanism has been modified to eliminate any risk of partial engagement.</p>\n<p><strong>Application to Production Line</strong></p>\n<p>Countermeasure has been applied from the start of 2008YM production.</p>\n<p><strong>Market Treatment</strong></p>\n<p>Honda (UK) will write to the registered owners of all affected vehicles requesting them to take their vehicle to their local Honda dealer to have a new handbrake lever fitted.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Here is a copy of the actual notice sent to owners:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hondacivicblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/handbrake.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-75\" title=\"Civic Handbrake - How To\" src=\"http://www.harostreetmedia.net/hondacivicblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2008/06/handbrake-198x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"198\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://hondacivicblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/handbrake-198x300.jpg 198w, https://hondacivicblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/handbrake.jpg 677w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 198px) 100vw, 198px\" /></a></p>\n<p>from: http://www.civinfo.com/forum/bugs-faults-irritations/9942-handbrake-self-release-inc-recall-letter-3.html#post124914</p>\n<p><a name=\"Threads\"></a></p>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin: 5px 0pt;width: 100%\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Zemified by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: medium none;float: right\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/pixie.png?x-id=55a461d9-b525-432c-9ac3-78b8ca08386d\" alt=\"\" /></a></div>\n",

I have been very busy with a new job and have not had time to keep the site up-to-date. Today I had some free time and decided to refresh the site by going back to the original design and changing the layout a bit. Here are some things you might notice:</p>\n<p>&#8211; Recent blog posts no longer show up on the front page. Only our &#8220;top story&#8221; of the day is displayed.</p>\n<p>&#8211; There are no more links to post categories. Some links to those posts have been integrated into the menu list. All posts are still here though.</p>\n<p>&#8211; The sidebar has been re-arranged. I believe it is a lot easier to navigate.</p>\n<p>&#8211; There are more ad&#8217;s. In order to keep this site up and running I need some form of income. There will be ad&#8217;s at the top of every post.</p>\n<p>Well I hope you like the original design and our new layout.

In the 11th annual ACEEE’s “Green Book® Online” ranking of environmentally responsible vehicles (available at www.greenercars.org), the natural gas-powered Civic GX ranked first with the gasoline Civic, Fit and Civic Hybrid joining the list of the 12 most environmentally-conscious vehicles available to the public.</p>\n<p>This is the eighth year in a row that a Honda vehicle received the number one ranking and the seventh consecutive year that Honda vehicles held at least four positions in the top 12, an impressive one-third of all vehicles on the list.</p>\n<p>“The ACEEE awards speak to the commitment Honda has made to lead the industry in lowering emissions, increasing fuel efficiency and reducing dependence on oil,” said John Mendel, executive vice president of American Honda. “Honda continues to set the standard for socially and environmentally-responsible automotive products and our commitment to alternative fuels will further expand with the zero emissions FCX Clarity fuel cell vehicle coming to market this summer.”</p>\n<p>Using a singular measure that incorporates fuel economy, health-related pollution impacts and global warming emissions, all vehicles are analyzed and given a “Green Score.” This score is used in ACEEE’s ranking system, resulting in a ranking of each vehicle’s total environmental performance, including a list of the 12 “greenest” and 12 “meanest” vehicles. The Civic GX, first introduced in 1998, is the cleanest internal combustion vehicle certified by the EPA*, and is 90% cleaner than the average gasoline-powered car on the road today.</p>\n<p>Honda has a long history of environmental leadership including the introduction of America’s first hybrid, the Honda Insight, delivery of the first fuel cell vehicle in the U.S., and the first vehicles to meet stricter emissions standards, including:</p>\n<p>&#8211; The first gasoline Low Emissions Vehicle (LEV), the 1996 Honda Civic.<br />\n&#8211; The first gasoline Ultra-Low Emissions vehicle (ULEV), the 1998 Honda Accord.<br />\n&#8211; The first gasoline Super Ultra-Low Emissions Vehicle (SULEV), the 2000 Honda Accord.<br />\n&#8211; The first Advanced Technology Partial-Zero Emissions Vehicle (AT-PZEV), the 2001 Civic GX natural gas vehicle.</p>\n<p>The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy is a nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing energy efficiency as a means of promoting both economic prosperity and environmental protection.</p>\n",

I think the old blue/white color&#8217;s were not representing Honda well. So I switched to a red/black/white look which really scream&#8217;s Honda. I have also added little Honda logo&#8217;s around the site to further incorporate a Honda theme. I hope you enjoy this skin as much as I do. Please feel free to give me feedback!</p>\n",

This article will give you some good information about where to find your motor swap so that when you recieve your motor you will be happy!</p>\n<p>1.) <strong>Pull From Original Car </strong>&#8211; One way to get your motor swap is from the original car that it was in. The hard part about this method is finding the right car with the motor you want. You can search junkyard&#8217;s for hours and not find anything worth buying. Another downside is that you might not know what the motor went through since the car is used and has had other owners. The advantage of pulling the motor from the original car is that you can see exactly how many miles are on it. Most motor websites say their motors have under 40,000 miles on them, but they dont provide proof and you will never know.</p>\n<p>2.) <strong>Buy Locally/Non-Commercial Seller</strong> &#8211; Another way to get your motor swap is to <!--more-->look locally or buy from a non-commercial seller. You can search through classified ad&#8217;s, internet forum&#8217;s, and swap meets. <a href=\"http://www.ebay.com/\">EBay.com</a> is a great way to buy motors and parts from non-commercial sellers. If you dont live in an area with many Honda parts, try searching online forums for non-commercial sellers who bought/pulled their motor and wants to sell it. Usually this is the cheapest place to get your swap from. The advantages of buying from a non-commercial seller is that prices are going to be low, you get to communicate person to person with the seller, and you can check out what your buying before you get it (sometimes).</p>\n<p>3.) <strong>Motor Website&#8217;s </strong>&#8211; Many websites have started up that sell used JDM/USDM motor swaps. One of the most popular website is <a href=\"http://www.hmotorsonline.com/\">HMotorsOnline.com</a>. Other popular sites include <a href=\"http://www.jaydm.com/\">JayDM.com</a>, <a href=\"http://www.jsamotors.com/\">JSAMotors.com</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.passwordjdm.com/\">PasswordJDM.com</a>. Most sites say their motors are under a certain mileage, but no-one can be sure. I have heard many people say they get junk motors from these sites even though they pay top prices.</p>\n<p>I hope this basic guide helps you decide where you are going to get your motor from. Dont rely on this guide to help you make your decision. Shop around to find the best deal for quality swaps.</p>\n",

A T28 is a hybrid between a T3 and a T25. I also deleted the adapter from the list because I have a hybrid turbo, which uses the T3 flange to connect to the manifold, which is T3.</p>\n<p>I also recieved my blow-off valve (BOV for short) and turbo manifold.

      "rendered": "<p>Well after days of research and eBay shopping I have come up with a rough parts list for my turbo project we talked about in the previous post. Please note that this list WILL change as the project goes on. Right now the cost of the kit is under $1200 but I havent added a new fuel pump or any misc. parts so it&#8217;s going to be hard to stay under $1500. This kit is not all about top notch performance. Its about getting to around 180 WHP for under $1500. So parts like the intercooler, gauges, and blow off valve are cheap eBay parts. Those kinds of parts dont need to be top of the line to be reliable. Parts like the turbo, however, will not be cheap. Anyway, here is the rough price list for all my parts:</p>\n<p>1.) Turbo &#8211; Garrett T-25 unit out of the 88&#8217;/89&#8242; 300ZX. $274.11</p>\n<p>2.) Manifold &#8211; Stainless steel, T3 flanged unit. $91.99</p>\n<p>3.) Adapter &#8211; GT-25 to T3 turbo adapter. $55.79</p>\n<p>4.) Blow-Off Valve &#8211; Red Type RS blow-off valve. $44.00</p>\n<p>5.) Intercooler/Piping &#8211; Intercooler, pipes, clamps, etc. $209.00</p>\n<p>6.) Oil Line Kit &#8211; Oil feed and oil drain lines. $85.00</p>\n<p>7.) Injectors &#8211; DSM 450cc injectors. Prices vary. $80.00</p>\n<p>8.) Fuel Filter/Pressure Gauge &#8211; Filter and gauge. $40.98</p>\n<p>9.) Downpipe &#8211; Stainless steel with flexpipe. $89.99</p>\n<p>10.) O2 Bung/Plug &#8211; O2 bung and plug. $5.25</p>\n<p>11.) Vacuum Manifold/Hoses &#8211; Manifold and hoses. $80.00</p>\n<p>12.) Gauges &amp; Pod &#8211; Boost, Air, Fuel pressure gauges in pod. $134.98</p>\n<p>Well that&#8217;s it for now. I will let you know when I recieve any items on the list, or make any changes to it. Please check back for my next post. Thanks!</p>\n",

In this post I will explain the basics of the project in terms of the car, the turbo parts, and other information. I will update you everytime something new happens with the project. For example, if I buy a new part, I will post telling you all about it and how it will contribute to the kit. I think you will really enjoy an in depth look into a turbo project. Read on!</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c343/baber0015/PB030009.jpg\" title=\"Honda Civic \" alt=\"Honda Civic \" align=\"middle\" /></p>\n<p>The donor car is a 1995 Honda Civic DX coupe. The original D15 was swapped for a Del Sol SI D16Z6 motor. The goal of this project is to obtain at least 170 WHP with a custom turbo kit that costs under $1500. The project should be completed within 4 months of this post depending on budget and time restraints. Upon finishing the project I will post a complete car profile with tons of pictures and information.</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c343/baber0015/PA220077.jpg\" title=\"D16Z6 Honda Engine\" alt=\"D16Z6 Honda Engine\" align=\"middle\" /></p>\n<p>So far the car has only basic and minimal modifications which include a CosmoRacing.com short shifter, Skunk2 Mega Power cat-back exhaust, and coilovers. The car also has Del Sol wheels which are lightweight. Hopefully, with the addition of a turbocharger, this car will be very fast.  This concludes the first post of the series. Please check back for more!</p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>You have probably heard the term H2B or F2B lately, but had no idea what it meant. If you felt stupid, you&#8217;re not alone! Many people have no idea what H2B/F2B means. This article is going to change that. I have put together some nice information about H2B/F2B swaps. Read up and you will understand what goes into the swap, how its done, and where to get started. Enjoy!</p>\n<p><strong>H2B/F2B Basics:</strong></p>\n<p>H2B (also called F2B; they are the same thing since F and H-Series transmissions have the same bolt pattern)  is simply mating a B-Series transmission to an H or F-Series engine. H2B swaps use mostly B-Series parts including axles, shift linkage, mounts, and the clutch/pressure plate.</p>\n<p>You may be wondering how on earth you can use B-Series mounts with an H or F-Series engine. Well since our Civics and Integra&#8217;s only have one mount connecting to the engine, we can use the B-Series mounts on the other two since they are on a B-Series transmission. A kit for H2B swaps includes a custom timing belt mount on the engine that will mount right up to a B-Series chassis mount. So now you can use all three B-Series mounts.</p>\n<p><strong>H2B Up&#8217;s and Down&#8217;s:</strong></p>\n<p>There is one main advantage of H2B, displacement. The popular H/F engines used are usually 2.2 liter. Big bore equals big power! H and F-Series longblocks are usually inexpensive which makes an H2B swap more cost effective than building a B-Series or buying a K-Series. K-Series swaps are new so they are very expensive. An H2B kit may seem expensive at first, but after its all said and done you will spend a lot less on an H2B swap than a K or B-Series motor that matches the power output of the H2B.</p>\n<p>There are also disadvantages of H2B swaps. First, hood clearence is an issue with some swaps. The engine will sit higher in the chassis than a normal H or F-Series swap. Also, stock or aftermarket H/F-Series headers cannot be used since the engine is tilted more vertically when using an H2B kit. You will need to fabricate your own header or buy a custom H2B header. Links to those headers are below. Another issue is oil drain. Some kits tilt the engine too far. Some kits require oil drain plug relocation.</p>\n<p><strong>Helpful H2B Links:</strong><br />\n<a href=\"http://evoindusa.uia.net/index.php/cPath/9_30?osCsid=fb88c7a40884f650588498c5ade98ba9\">H2B EVO Kit</a> &#8211; A link to the EVO H2B Kit website.<br />\n<a href=\"http://quartersportsdrag.com/H2B.html\">H2B QSD Kit</a> &#8211; A link to the QSD H2B Kit website.<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.explicitspeedperformance.net/H22Aalt.html\">Alternator Bracket</a> &#8211; A link to a prefabricated alternator bracket for your H2B swap.<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.camp1320.com/products/campheaders.htm\">H2B Header</a> &#8211; A link to the custom H2B header for your swap.<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/rmf_headers\">Another H2B Header</a> &#8211; Another custom H2B header.<br />\n<a href=\"http://bisimoto.com/wst_page6.html\">Another Header</a> &#8211; Again, here is another header option for H2B swaps.</p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>    If you know anything about cars you have probably heard of VTEC. But do you actually know what it is, what it does, or what it stands for? This article is designed to teach you the in&#8217;s and out&#8217;s of VTEC. After you are done reading you will finally understand why people love thier VTEC engines so much. Please enjoy!</p>\n<p><em><strong>Introduction to VTEC</strong></em></p>\n<p>VTEC (standing for Variable valve Timing and Electronic Lift Control) is a system developed by Honda to improve the combustion efficiency of its internal combustion engines throughout the RPM range. This was the first system of its kind and eventually led to different types of variable valve timing and lift control systems that were later designed by other manufacturers (VVTL-i from Toyota, VarioCam Plus from Porsche, and so on). It was invented by Honda&#8217;s chief engine designer Kenichi Nagahiro.</p>\n<p>In the regular four-stroke automobile engine, the intake and exhaust valves are actuated by lobes on a camshaft. The shape of the lobes determines the timing, lift and duration of each valve. Timing refers to when a valve is opened or closed with respect to the combustion cycle. Lift refers to how much the valve is opened. Duration refers to how long the valve is kept open. Due to the behavior of the gases (air and fuel mixture) before and after combustion, which have physical limitations on their flow, as well as their interaction with the ignition spark, the optimal valve timing, lift and duration settings under low RPM engine operations are very different from those under high RPM. Optimal low RPM valve timing, lift and duration settings would result in<!--more--> insufficient fuel and air at high RPM, thus greatly limiting engine power output. Conversely, optimal high RPM valve timing, lift and duration settings would result in very rough low RPM operation and difficult idling. The ideal engine would have fully variable valve timing, lift and duration, in which the valves would always open at exactly the right point, lift high enough and stay open just the right amount of time for the engine speed in use. VTEC can be used not only for economy but also for performance.</p>\n<p>In practice, a fully variable valve timing engine is difficult to design and implement. Attempts have been made, using solenoids to control valves instead of the typical springs-and-cams setup, however these designs have not made it into production automobiles as they are very complicated and costly.</p>\n<p>The opposite approach to variable timing is to produce a camshaft which is better suited to high RPM operation. This approach means that the vehicle will run very poorly at low RPM (where most automobiles spend much of their time) and much better at high RPM. VTEC is the result of an effort to marry high RPM performance with low RPM stability.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Japan has a tax on engine displacement, requiring Japanese auto manufacturers to make higher-performing engines with lower displacement. In cars such as the Toyota Supra and Nissan 300ZX, this was accomplished with a turbocharger. In the case of the Mazda RX-7 (turbo) and RX-8, a wankel rotary engine was used. VTEC serves as yet another method to derive very high specific output from lower displacement motors.</p>\n<p><em><strong>DOHC VTEC</strong></em></p>\n<p>Honda&#8217;s VTEC system is a simple method of endowing the engine with multiple camshaft profiles optimized for low and high RPM operations. Instead of one cam lobe actuating each valve, there are two &#8211; one optimized for low RPM stability &amp; fuel efficiency, with the other designed to maximize high RPM power output. Switching between the two cam lobes is determined by engine oil pressure, engine temperature, vehicle speed, and engine speed. As engine RPM increases, a locking pin is pushed by oil pressure to bind the high RPM cam follower for operation. From this point on, the valve opens and closes according to the high-speed profile, which opens the valve further and for a longer time. The DOHC VTEC system has high and low RPM cam lobe profiles on both the intake and exhaust valve camshafts.</p>\n<p>The VTEC system was originally introduced as a DOHC system in the 1989 Honda Integra sold in Japan, which used a 160 hp (119 kW) variant of the B16A engine. The US market saw the first VTEC system with the introduction of the 1991 Acura NSX, which used a DOHC VTEC V6. DOHC VTEC engines soon appeared in other vehicles, such as the 1992 Acura Integra GS-R.</p>\n<p><em><strong>SOHC VTEC</strong></em></p>\n<p>As popularity and marketing value of the VTEC system grew, Honda applied the system to SOHC engines, which shares a common camshaft for both intake and exhaust valves. The trade-off is that SOHC engines only benefit from the VTEC mechanism on the intake valves. This is because in the SOHC engine, the spark plugs need to be inserted at an angle to clear the camshaft, and in the SOHC engine, the spark plug tubes are situated between the two exhaust valves, making VTEC on the exhaust impossible.</p>\n<p><em><strong>SOHC VTEC-E</strong></em></p>\n<p>Honda&#8217;s next version of VTEC, VTEC-E, was used in a slightly different way; instead of optimising performance at high RPM, it was used to increase efficiency at low RPM. At low RPM, one of the two intake valves is only allowed to open a very small amount, increasing the fuel/air atomization in the cylinder and thus allowing a leaner mixture to be used. As the engine&#8217;s speed increases, both valves are needed to supply sufficient mixture. A sliding pin, which is pressured by oil, as in the regular VTEC, is used to connect both valves together and allows the full opening of the second valve.</p>\n<p><em><strong>SOHC 3-Stage VTEC</strong></em></p>\n<p>Honda also introduced a 3-stage VTEC system in select markets, which combines the features of both SOHC VTEC and SOHC VTEC-E. At low speeds, only one intake valve is used. At medium speeds, two are used. At high speeds, the engine switches to a high-speed cam profile as in regular VTEC. Thus, both low-speed economy and high-speed efficiency and power are improved.</p>\n<p><em><strong>iVTEC</strong></em></p>\n<p>i-VTEC (The i stands for intelligent) introduced continuously variable camshaft phasing on the intake cam of DOHC VTEC engines. The technology first appeared on Honda&#8217;s K-series four cylinder engine family in 2001 (2002 in the U.S.). Valve lift and duration are still limited to distinct low and high rpm profiles, but the intake camshaft is now capable of advancing between 25 and 50 degrees (depending upon engine configuration) during operation. Phase changes are implemented by a computer controlled, oil driven adjustable cam gear. Phasing is determined by a combination of engine load and rpm, ranging from fully retarded at idle to maximum advance at full throttle and low rpm. The effect is further optimization of torque output, especially at low and midrange RPM.</p>\n<p>For the K-Series motors there are two different types of i-VTEC systems implemented. The first is for the performance motors like in the RSX Type S or the TSX and the other is for economy motors found in the CR-V or Accord. The performance i-VTEC system is basically the same as the DOHC VTEC system of the B16A&#8217;s, both intake and exhaust have 3 cam lobes per cylinder. However the valvetrain has the added benefit of roller rockers and continuously variable intake cam timing. The economy i-VTEC is more like the SOHC VTEC-E in that the intake cam has only two lobes, one very small and one larger, as well as no VTEC on the exhaust cam. The two types of motor are easily distiguishable by the factory rated power output: the performance motors make around 200 hp or more in stock form and the economy motors do not make much more than 160 hp from the factory.</p>\n<p>In 2004, Honda introduced an i-VTEC V6 (an update of the venerable J-series), but in this case, i-VTEC had nothing to do with cam phasing. Instead, i-VTEC referred to Honda&#8217;s cylinder deactivation technology which closes the valves on one bank of (3) cylinders during light load and low speed (below 80 mph) operation. The technology was originally introduced to the US on the Honda Odyssey Mini Van, and can now be found on the Honda Accord Hybrid and the 2006 Honda Pilot.</p>\n<p>An additional version of i-VTEC was introduced on the 2006 Honda Civic&#8217;s R-series four cylinder SOHC engines. This implementation uses the so-called &#8220;economy cams&#8221; on one of the two intake valves of each cylinder. The &#8220;economy cams&#8221; are designed to delay the closure of the intake valve they act upon, and are activated at low rpms and under light loads. When the &#8220;economy cams&#8221; are activated, one of the two intake valves in each cylinder closes well after the piston has started moving upwards in the compression stroke. That way, a part of the mixture that has entered the combustion chamber is forced out again, into the intake manifold. That way, the engine &#8220;emulates&#8221; a lower displacement than its actual one (its operation is also similar to an Atkinson cycle engine, with uneven compression and combustion strokes), which reduces fuel consumption and increases its efficiency. During the operation with the &#8220;economy cams&#8221;, the (by-wire) throttle butterfly is kept fully open, in order to reduce pumping losses. According to Honda, this measure alone can reduce pumping losses by 16%. In higher rpms and under heavier loads, the engine switches back into its &#8220;normal cams&#8221;, and it operates like a regular 4 stroke Otto cycle engine. This implementation of i-VTEC was initially introduced in the R18A1 engine found under the bonnet of the 8th generation Civic, with a displacement of 1,8lt and an output of 140Ps. Recently, another variant was released, the 2-litre R20A2 with an output of 150Ps, which powers the EUDM version of the all-new CRV.</p>\n",

You can match them with other accent peices on your car to create a balanced look. What better way to compliment those new rims than to paint your brake calipers? Here are instuctions to paint your own calipers and drums!</p>\n<p>First we will list some of the materials you will need to perform this project. Here is a list of materials you may want to have:</p>\n<p>&#8211; Jack, Jackstands</p>\n<p>&#8211; Wire Brush</p>\n<p>&#8211; Caliper Paint Kit (Duplicolor makes a kit, check and autoparts store)</p>\n<p>The first thing you want to do is jack up your car and secure it with jackstands. Don&#8217;t waste your time painting and then have your car fall to the ground! Next, you need to remove any old paint, dust, or oil from the calipers/drums. Use your wire brush and brake cleaner to do this job. After your calipers/drums are clean, its time to start painting.</p>\n<p>Follow the instructions on the caliper paint kit. Apply the recommended amount of coats and allow for plenty of drying time between coats. You can use masking tape to cover parts that you do not want painted. And remember, you dont have to paint parts you wont be able to see, so dont waste paint.</p>\n",

    },
    "content": {
      "rendered": "<p>We all know that Honda&#8217;s are like Lego&#8217;s. Many parts are interchangible and a combination can be formed to create a very fast car from stock OEM parts. One popular solution to more HP is a motor swap. There are many swaps available for Honda chassis, but some are NOT recommended. Here is a list of swaps that you should not do! I found this on HondaSwap.com.</p>\n<p><strong> 4th gen</strong></p>\n<p>* D16Y7/8<br />\n* B16A2 (USDM)<br />\n* B16A3<br />\n* 96+ B18C<br />\n* 96+ B18B<br />\n* B18C5<br />\n* any H-series<br />\n* any C-series motor</p>\n<p>We don&#8217;t recommend these motors for several reasons. The H-series will require much chassis denting, and while that may be cool to do on a race <a href=\"http://hondaswap.com/#\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"border-bottom: 0.075em solid darkgreen;font-weight: normal;font-size: 100%;text-decoration: underline;color: darkgreen;background-color: transparent;padding-bottom: 1px\" class=\"iAs\" rel=\"noopener\">car</a>, it makes your bay look like crap and can lead to a weaker engine bay. In addition, you wont have room for A/C or power steering if those options are required by you.The other motors are OBD-2, requiring a much greater challenge in wiring. The B- and D-series OBD-2 motors can be installed into the chassis fairly easily with a mount kit, but as stated above, the wiring is an absolute nightmare.</p>\n<p><strong> 5th gen</strong></p>\n<p>* B16A SiR<br />\n* B17A<br />\n* B18A<br />\n* ZC/D16A6/8/9<br />\n* any C-series motor</p>\n<p>We don&#8217;t recommend these motors for several reasons as well. These motors are OBD-0, making it a hard swap into a car wired for OBD-1. It is easier to go backwards (as in, taking a 5th gen motor into a 4th gen chassis) than forwards. Remember, its all about backwards compatibility, not forwards.<br />\nWhile we haven&#8217;t listed the H-series motors as a non-recommended swap, we would like to say a few words about it. An H-series motor is generally 60-80 lbs heavier than a B-series motor. This adds to the already poor F/R weight distribution of Civics/Integra&#8217;s. While it can be solved with a set of stiffer springs and tighter shocks up front, it is still not a good choice for an AutoX or road course car. For drag, it excels. It&#8217;s heavier, putting more weight on the front wheels to help with <a href=\"http://hondaswap.com/#\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"border-bottom: 0.075em solid darkgreen;font-weight: normal;font-size: 100%;text-decoration: underline;color: darkgreen;background-color: transparent;padding-bottom: 1px\" class=\"iAs\" rel=\"noopener\">traction</a>. In addition to the weight factor, the chassis will need to be modified a little bit to fit it. Some things on the fire wall will need to be moved (such as brake master cylinder) off the wall. The drivers side quarter panel will also need to be dented in a little bit so the crank pulley doesn&#8217;t rub.</p>\n<p><strong> 6th gen</strong></p>\n<p>* B16A SiR<br />\n* B16A3<br />\n* B17A<br />\n* B18A<br />\n* 94-95 B18C<br />\n* 94-95 B18B<br />\n* ZC/D16A6/8/9<br />\n* any C-series motor</p>\n<p>The reasons for these motors is similar to the 5th gen&#8217;s, only now we include OBD-1 in the list. When you own an OBD-2 chassis, the easiest swaps are OBD-2 motors.<br />\nThe same general principles apply for the H-series motors as listed in the 5th gen&#8217;s explanation.</p>\n<p><strong> 7th gen</strong></p>\n<p>* any B-series motor<br />\n* any D-series motor &lt;2001<br />\n* any C-series motor<br />\n* any H-series motor<br />\n* any F-series motor</p>\n<p>The new Civic&#8217;s share the i-VTEC and mounting patterns of the RSX. Neither chassis will accept an older motor. The standard D17 in the Civic or the K20 in the Civic Si/RSX are the new platforms of which Honda hybrid making will be in the future.</p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>It&#8217;s the time of year when the leaves are falling, a fat man slides down your chimney, and its freakin&#8217; cold outside! You need to protect your Honda from the harsh conditions if you want it to last in the blistering cold. Here are just a few basic tips to ensure you and your car&#8217;s safety.</p>\n<p><strong>Tires</strong> &#8211; Make sure you are driving on all-season or winter tires with good tread. It&#8217;s very important to be able to control your car on those snow and ice covered roads. <font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=\"2\"><font face=\"Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\">Make sure your tires are properly rotated and aligned. Your tires should not b worn down to less than 2/32 on an inch for normal tires and 5/32 of an inch for snow tires.</font></font></p>\n<p><strong>Anti-Freeze </strong>&#8211; It may not sound important during cold weather, but your cooling system is crucial to surviving the cold. Make sure you have plenty of anti-freeze in your system. If you havent replaced the anti-freeze in your car for more than 2 years, it&#8217;s time to flush it and get some more anti-freeze. Sometimes anti-freeze can lose its ability to withstand freezing tempetures. Or, if you have added water to your mix, make sure to flush the system and add new anti-freeze. Make sure no hoses are cracked or have leaks. Check your radiator, thermostat, and radiator cap. Make sure your heater and defroster are functional.</p>\n<p><strong>Oil</strong> &#8211; It&#8217;s a good idea to change your oil before the winter months. When changing your oil, select the lowest recommended grade of oil in your owners manual. For most passenger cars, this grade is 5W-30. Also consider using a synthetic oil, as this kind of oil resists cold temp. sludge buildup.</p>\n<p><strong>Battery</strong> &#8211; It&#8217;s a good idea to replace your battery every three to four years. If you don&#8217;t think your battery can hold up in the cold weather, have a shop check it out for you. If it&#8217;s time to replace your battery, look for one with more starting power and higher cranking amps.</p>\n<p>Those are just the basics in winter car care. Hopefully your Honda will be reliable through the winter months. If you have done all the things outlined in this article you should be a happy driver this winter. Happy Holidays!</p>\n",

Lip kits are the future and big bumpers and side skirts are a thing of the past. Lip&#8217;s are basically bumper extensions. Some cars come with a lip from the factory. Lips enhance styling while keeping a clean, professional look because they are mounted to your stock bumpers. Most of the time installation is quick and easy.</p>\n<p>Now that you want a lip kit for your Honda, where do you get one? Well thats easy. You can visit a nice car part website like <a href=\"http://www.procivic.com/\">ProCivic.com</a>, or you can check out the great deals on <a href=\"http://www.ebay.com/\">eBay.com</a>. Most lip&#8217;s come with all parts and hardware needed to install it, whichs leads us to our next question. How do I install a lip?

The automaker may have been slow to respond, but something sweet is lurking on the horizon, and because CR-Y just sounds funny, Honda has decided to name it CR-Z.</span></p>\n<p class=\"blogs_single_post_paragraph\"><a href=\"http://www.carmagazine.co.uk/first_official_picture.php?sid=1189&amp;page=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Car Magazine</a> was first to report the unveiling of the CR-Z concept, as well as break some details on the (hopefully) upcoming Honda coupe. A two-plus-two design, the car will be powered by a new IMA hybrid system, most probably a 1.6L (at least) gas engine making 170-180 bhp, paired with electric motors supplying at least 30 more horses to the wheels. While 200 hp in an old CR-X might have qualified it as a Death Rocket, these days it&#8217;s nothing much to brag about. Mid-range is where Honda&#8217;s hybrid system excels though, so expect considerable punch at cruising speeds where it&#8217;s most useful.</p>\n<p class=\"blogs_single_post_paragraph\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"http://image.automotive.com/f/concept-cars/honda-cr-z-concept-shows-new-direction-at-tokyo-motor-show/7214181+w275+h160+cr1+re0+ar1/honda-cr-z-front-right.jpg\" title=\"Honda CR-Z\" alt=\"Honda CR-Z\" align=\"right\" height=\"127\" width=\"275\" /> It&#8217;s also reported the drivetrain components will be broken up and distributed around the body, lowering center of gravity and overall balance. In short, it&#8217;s going to be a handler.</p>\n<p>The car is smaller and lighter than the current Civic coupe, but we have to ponder the dismissal of Acura&#8217;s RSX primarily because of its relative placement and thus competition to the Civic. It just no longer made sense to Honda, so how will the Cr-Z play against the Civic Si? Car Magazine thinks the model&#8217;s primary competition when it&#8217;s brought to market in 2009 will be Volkswagen&#8217;s forthcoming three-door coupe, the Scirocco, and the Mercedes C-class coupe. Maybe, maybe not. However, we&#8217;re not going to get too critical of any decision to revive God&#8217;s Own Chariot. Cost is expected to be around $20,000. We cant wait!</p>\n",

    },
    "content": {
      "rendered": "<p>There are basically a few different ways to make more power out of your Honda engine. In this guide I will explain each method, describing the advantages and disadvantages of each, and also comparing them. This guide should help you choose the route to more power for your Honda. Enjoy!</p>\n<p>First, you need to decide how much power you want, how reliable you want your car to be, and how much you are willing to spend. The budget aspect is the most important. To make big power, you need big bucks. Different engines respond to modifications differently, so that is another factor to research. We wont get into each specific engine type in this article. We will only describle the methods for getting more power on a universal level. Here are ways to make big power from your Honda:</p>\n<p>1.) Forced Induction &#8211; This is one of the more popular routes to go. Adding a turbocharger/supercharger to a Honda engine is the cheapest way to create lots of power from most Honda engines. Companies like Greddy and Jackson Racing make turbocharger/supercharger kits that directly bolt on to your Honda. Forced induction systems are easy to expand. You can create more and more power by increasing your PSI. The downside of forced induction is the reliability. A Honda with a turbocharger/supercharger can be very reliable with good tuning and engine building, but some people get carried away with the amount of power they are putting on stock engine components. Aftermarket engine components are a good idea to consider when adding forced induction, although it is not always needed with a mild PSI setting. The amount of power an engine can handle depends on the engine.</p>\n<p>2.) Motor Swap &#8211; A very popular way to obtain an increase in power is a motor swap. A motor swap is when an engine from a Honda is placed into the chassis of another Honda that the engine did not come in from the factory. Most Honda engines are interchangable with most Honda chassis. A very popular swap is putting a Civic SI or Type R motor into lower model (DX, LX, EX) Civics. There are also mini swaps, where the engine head of one engine is placed onto the block of a different engine, resulting in a more powerful combination that the original motor. The advantage of swapping motors is that reliablilty is not hurt since a stock motor from another Honda is being used instead of a modified motor with forced induction or another type of big power adder. The disadvantage is that motor swaps are hard to install and are sometimes very expensive.</p>\n<p>3.) N/A Motor Build  &#8211; Some people choose to take their stock motors and modify them with camshafts, nitrous, high compression pistons, intake manifolds, intakes, etc. Building your stock motor (or swapped motor) is a great way to go if you plan to slowly invest in your Honda. Since you don&#8217;t have to buy a whole motor or forced induction kit at one time, it allows people to spend less money at one time. The disadvantage is that after it is all said and done, going the N/A route will cost a lot more money than a forced induction kit or motor swap to reach the same HP goal.</p>\n<p>Some people choose to combine all three methods to create an awsome engine. Hopefully this little article helped you choose which route is right for you. Thanks for reading.</p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>Nothing creates a dramatic visual effect in your engine bay quite like a nicely painted valve cover. This tutorial will teach you the steps of painting your very own valve cover. We have included a material list and step by step instructions that you will need to make your valve cover look professionally painted. Here is the list of materials needed:</p>\n<p>1.) Brake/engine cleaner</p>\n<p>2.) High-temp paint</p>\n<p>3.) 800 grit (or similar) wet sand paper</p>\n<p>4.) Steel wool or fine sand paper (optional)</p>\n<p>5.) Clear coat (optional)</p>\n<p>All this should cost no more than $20. You can find these things at your local auto parts store or Wal-Mart. Now lets get to painting your valve cover!</p>\n<p>1.) Remove the valve cover and place it on a trashbag, peice of newspaper, or anything that you dont mind painting along with your valve cover.</p>\n<p>2.) Clean the valve cover with your brake/engine cleaner to remove all dirt, oil, and dust. Make sure its totally dry before you start painting.</p>\n<p>3.) This step is optional. Use steel wool or very find sand paper to roughen up the surface of the valve cover. This step will help the paint stick better, resulting in a better looking valve cover.</p>\n<p>4.) Now its time to paint. Use your high-temp paint and apply several coats to the valve cover. Make sure to allow at least 5 minutes of drying time between coats. Paint until you are happy with the color. Please note that you are even painting over the &#8220;Honda&#8221; letters in this step. We will sand off the letters later!</p>\n<p>5.) This is the hard part. You want to wet sand the letters on the valve cover to give them a nice shine. The letters will look like polished metal in the end. To do this, use a block of wood or something similar to hold the sand paper with. Doing it by hand will risk sanding other areas of the valve cover. Use water and sand over the letters until you are happy with the look. This can take more than 10 minutes so be patient.</p>\n<p>6.) Rinse the valve cover and dry it. You are done unless you want to apply a clear coat. Thats an optional step. How does it look? Good right? Ya, I though so!</p>\n",

A few years back the cool thing to do was to add huge body kits, wings, and pointless other accessories. This period also included huge chrome or bright colored rims. Today&#8217;s generation of Honda tuners is different. No more do you see kids with big wings and rims. The clean style is in. People are leaving the bodies of their Honda&#8217;s stock, and thats what we want.</p>\n<p>Now that the body modifications are becoming a thing of the past, how about the wheels? Many people think the only way to get a great looking ride is to buy aftermarket wheels. Thats not true. Many tuners are turning to the OEM wheel scene. Over the years, Honda has produced some great looking OEM wheels. The benifits to choosing OEM over aftermarket are as follows:</p>\n<p>1.) Cheaper!!! OEM wheels are going to cost less usually. This is because many people get rid of them after buying aftermarket wheels for their Honda.</p>\n<p>2.) Lighter!!! Usually OEM wheels are lighter than aftermarket. Light is good, because less power is required to spin the wheels. This means better acceleration and braking.</p>\n<p>3.) OEM look is hot!!! Sleeper&#8217;s are awesome. A clean looking Honda with a stock body and OEM wheels looks sick!</p>\n<p>Now that you are hooked on OEM wheels, which ones do you get? Which ones exist? Are you lost? Dont worry! Here is a list of some great looking OEM wheels to look out for (Click the name for a picture of the wheels):</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://img391.imageshack.us/img391/1128/70ce.jpg\">HX Wheels</a> &#8211; These are very popular. They have an aggressive look and they are one of the lightest Honda rims made. They have a little brother, VX wheels, that are smaller and lighter.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.norcalcrx.org/droppedcrxsi/minimeet-side.jpg\">Fat Fives</a> &#8211; Fat Fives come off Integra&#8217;s. They are also a very popular wheel because of the clean five-spoke design. They also have a little brother that is smaller, from Del Sol&#8217;s.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i28.photobucket.com/albums/c237/214Irving/IMG_2767.jpg\">SI Wheels</a> &#8211; Si&#8217;s are great wheels too. They are one of the most expensive OEM wheels because they are so sought after.</p>\n<p>Remember, we just skimmed the surface in this article. There are lots of other rims to look for. EP3&#8217;s, OEM Del Sol rims, GSR Blades, GSR Snowflakes, etc. Just do a search on Google to find the wheels for you!</p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>When you lower the car, the camber will go out and you need a camber kit to fix it. However, I find it is not necessary to correct the camber in most cases. Most people think they need a camber kit because of a tire-wear concern. The reality is, TOE ANGLE kills tires WAY faster than camber ever will.</p>\n<p>Sound like a bold statement? Conventional wisdom is that when you lower the car you need a camber kit if you don&#8217;t wanna wear out the tires fast. Well, there is another adjustment/spec here than nobody has mentioned. Caster is another key.</p>\n<p>When you lower a double wishbone car like the 88-00 Civics, 90-01 Integras, Accords, TSX, etc, the camber angle always increases in a negative direction: The wheels tilt inwards. It is what makes the car handle better in turns than strut cars. It is a natural effect of cycling a double-wishbone suspension.</p>\n<p>Lowering many cars also increases the toe angle, which is to say it points the tires outward. They kinda fight for direction where the car wants to go.</p>\n<p>But also, realize that all cars have some positive caster. The means that when you turn the wheel, the axis of rotation is not 90 degrees. You may notice it more exaggerated on BMWs and Benzes. The best way to view the angle is to turn the wheel all the way to one side, and get out and look at your car. Notice the wheel is turned, but also kind flopped over? Have a friend with a S500 (if you have one) do donuts while you watch outside. The wheels really flop over on those cars!</p>\n<p>Think of it like pushing a wheel barrow. The angle from the axle to the handle is like caster. Pick up a wheel barrow and stand it veritcal on the tire with the handles straight in the air. Now imagine pushing it and trying to turn it. Haha&#8230;it just fell on you! Now imagine pushing and turning it normally. Much easier. Much more stable. And when you trun it, the tire is not actually turning. It flops over on it&#8217;s side and leans! That is how your car turns too! That is how motorcylcles turn and well.</p>\n<p>Caster is great for high speed stability. That is why all cars have some dialed in. Without it, the car would be super twitchy and hard to control at speed. It&#8217;s why autobahn burners have more caster than your typical Japanese car.</p>\n<p>The problem is, when you lower the car and toe angle is thrown out, the wheels are actually riding on the inside edges of the tire as they grind away pulling the car in different directions! This is in addition to the increased camber effect! With an improper alignment the car will WASTE tires in a matter of months (or weeks if you drive like me).</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px\">The trick to lowering the car and having the tires last is to get a good 4-wheel alignment to fix the toe angle.</span>  I have had over a dozen hondas, all lowered, and most lowered past 2&#8243;. I have never had a camber kit on ANY of my cars. The ONLY car that I had a problem with tires with was my 94 accord which I had never aligned. Go figure.</p>\n<p>amber will tend to wear tires out somewhat quicker than stock, but generally speaking, with a good toe alignment, the increased wear will not be cumbersome or even really significant. The added camber actually makes the car handle a little better. Also, a little camber in conjuntion with the caster will wear the tires out almost evenly! So why get rid of it?</p>\n<p>Here are some images to illustrate what I mean.</p>\n<p>In this image, you can see where the inside and outside of the tire are. The red dots are there to help you identify the wear-indicators inside the tire grooves. When the tires wear down to these wear-bars, you know it is time to replace the tires. These tires are almost there:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"http://www.heeltoeauto.com/files/tech/tirewear/thumbnails/IMG_0468.jpg\" title=\"Camber Wear\" alt=\"Camber Wear\" height=\"75\" width=\"100\" /></p>\n<p>Now, you can see how the tire is worn more toward the inside&#8230;that&#8217;s camber wear. This customer was driving on this tire, with the car lowered moderately with a good alignment. He has not maximized tire wear, but clearly he has not greatly suffered either. No camber kit was installed.</p>\n<p>In the next image, we have a tire which was lowered aggressively, and the car was NOT aligned.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"http://www.heeltoeauto.com/files/tech/tirewear/thumbnails/IMG_0470.jpg\" title=\"Toe Wear\" alt=\"Toe Wear\" height=\"75\" width=\"100\" /></p>\n<p>Look how aggressively the tire has worn on the inside edge. The cords are even showing. This wear is caused by TOE angle. The direction of wear here is dramatically different than a camber-worn tire. This type of wear will kill a brand new set of tires in a matter of months. Mistakenly, people will lower their cars, not align them, get this wear, and blame it on camber. The timeline continues when the customer buys a camber kit, installs it, and the wear goes away. Must have been the camber kit, right? It was the toe, people. Also note, this is a front tire.</p>\n<p>With a drop under 1.75&#8243;, you should not need to even worry about it, because a drop of that much will not even throw the car out of factory camber specs! But that toe will be in the red every time!</p>\n",
