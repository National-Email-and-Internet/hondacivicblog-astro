K20Z3 – 197-hp, 2.0-Liter, DOHC i-VTEC

The 2.0-liter, dual-overhead camshaft K20Z3 engine in the Civic Si Sedan produces 197 horsepower at 7800 rpm and 139 lb.-ft. of torque at 6100 rpm.

Thanks to special Honda-developed performance technologies, such as the ultra-precise Drive-by-Wire™ throttle system, 3-rocker i-VTEC® variable valve timing, a cold-air intake and equal-length exhaust header, the K20Z3 engine boasts an impressive flat torque curve from idle, all the way to its race car-like 8000-rpm redline.

Plus, the K20Z3's intake and exhaust system is quiet and unobtrusive when cruising at highway speed, but produces an aggressive, sporty sound at full throttle.
