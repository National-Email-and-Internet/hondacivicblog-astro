![Eight Gen Civic](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/06-Civic-LX.jpg/250px-06-Civic-LX.jpg)

For 2006, Honda completely redesigned the Civic giving it a more athletic, curvier look. All models (including the base model) come standard with ABS and side and curtain airbags. Additionally, the 2006 models acquired a ULEV-2 (Ultra Low Emission Vehicle) rating and boast a more powerful 1.8 liter engine than the 2005 counterparts, but still retain almost equal fuel economy. In the North American market, the sedan, coupé, coupé Si, and Hybrid models are available. A Sedan Si has been announced for the 2007 model year (this is the first ever Civic Si sedan). The Sedan and Coupe all come in 3 available trims (DX, LX, EX) while the Civic Si and Hybrid are sold "as is" with relatively few options (such as a navigation system, automatic day/night compass mirrors, and wheel locks).

The DX model is the base model that comes equipped with LATCH, immobilizer theft-deterrent system, power windows, daytime running lights (DRL), 15&#8243; wheels with covers, driver's seat height adjustment, and other features (All Canadian sold Civics have the 160 watt stereo system) as well as the DX-G model in Canada adds air conditioning, auxiliary input jack for portable audio players, power door locks, remote keyless entry and storage console armrest.

The LX model adds a 160 watt 6-speaker stereo system, air conditioning, 16&#8243; wheels with covers (Alloy wheels in Canadian LX models), cruise control, MP3/audio jack, passenger side walk in with memory (Coupe only), floor mats, security system with remote entry and Canadian sold models (except for DX) include heated exterior mirrors.

The EX model adds a moonroof, 4 wheel disc brakes, 16&#8243; alloy wheels, an additional 12-volt accessory outlet (for a total of 2), a 350 watt stereo system with 7 speakers (Coupe only, the Sedan EX comes with a 160 watt stereo system), exterior temperature indicator, a foldable rear arm rest with integrated cupholders, and an optional voice-activated navigation system.

The Coupes come standard with a rear spoiler and on the EX models (only) have chrome finish on the exhaust pipe. They are typically a bit sportier than their Sedan counterparts and cost US$200 (AU$254) less in the US and CDN$200 (AU$217) more in Canada at base MSRP. It should be noted that the EX model of both the Coupe and Sedan are actually a bit smaller, in terms of interior room (because of the sunroof, which takes up head-room), than their DX and LX counterparts. MSRP is US$14,810 (18.881) for the DX Manual Coupe to approximately $21K for the Si models.

Only a continuously variable transmission (CVT) is offered for the 2006 Honda Civic Hybrid, which gains more power and a mileage boost to an EPA estimated 49/51 mpg (city/highway). It achieves an AT-PZEV emission rating.
