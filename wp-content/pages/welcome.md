Over the same period, Ford sold 4,778 of the 3dr Focus ST (all variants), while the 3dr Golf GTI (incl. Edition 30) recorded a total of 1,984 sales. And that's not all. Here are some more Type R facts from the past 12 months:

– In response to previous Type R customers' pleas for a more refined, high specification cabin, Honda introduced the GT grade – and a huge 90 per cent of customers opt for this more comfortable, better-equipped Civic

– During 2007, the Civic Type R won Top Gear magazine's Hot Hatch of the Year and scooped the same award in Auto Express' New Car Honours
