Yup it seems to be for real!  **Oh no it doesn't – Thank you Bill!** (see his comment) as he rightly points out &#8216;if it is too good to be true, it is!'. I did a bunch of other searches for &#8216;Surge Engineering' and come up with report after report after report of &#8216;scam', &#8216;doesn't work' etc. some of them are as follows:

Whew…how could I have missed all that! (sorry folks, will dig deeper next time)

Anyway, what this &#8216;thing' does (according to a few of the posts above is:

Have a look at the Surge Performance Chip (available from yourhotcar.com among other places). It claims to add up to 35 [Horse Power](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsepower) (from 7-10%  gain in power from stock) and 20+ Ft Lbs of torque.

Like all good performance chips it is fully adjustable for either Horsepower or gas mileage by using a knob (yes a knob)

The Surge performance chip simply wires into the factory harness of the IAT sensor and just provides a new signal for your cars internal [Electronic Control Unit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_control_unit) (ECU – all modern cars have an ECU to electronically manage and monitor your vehicle’s   performance, by default they are tuned to government regulations…which means that they are inefficient!) You could replace the ECU (at a cost in the $1,000's). This performance chip negates the need to replace the ECU by giving the existing ECU an external controller.

According to surge, it takes only 15-30 minutes to install and can easily be removed or re-installed at any time.

I don't know about you but this sounds like a mod for anybody!

Pass people, pass!
