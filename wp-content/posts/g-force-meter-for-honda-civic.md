**G-Force!**
![G Meter](http://gizmodo.com/assets/resources/2008/04/250_gforce.jpg)

Ever wanted to know just how much your Performance [Honda Civic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_Civic) can handle in the corners? or at breaking or accelerating? Then the  video below is for you!

How to create, no make, a GForce meter for your Civic. (for any car really, but hey, this is about Honda Civic's!)

Look out local police departments, I can see a raft of local civic lovers competing to see just how many G's they can pull (not recommended…trouble at the end of that tunnel). In any event this is a quick excellent tutorial on how to assemble a fairly decent G-Force meter, although I think the suction cup mounting system is a bit hokey!
