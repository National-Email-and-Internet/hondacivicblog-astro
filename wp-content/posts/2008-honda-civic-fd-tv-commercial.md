This is one of the &#8216;Honda – the power of dreams' tv commercials for the Honda Civic FD. Too be quite honest, it is a fairly non-descript commercial, a bit forumla and a bit boring. Mind you Honda North America has never been famous for outstanding commercials – unless some of you out there can point me to some good ones…I will dig some more myself and see what I can find from the Honda Civic Ad agencies….
